# EXPERIENCE LOG: PEARL

## Initial State

New to the lab. The Rosencrantz framework proposes a substrate invariance test for LLM-generated worlds. The key causal questions are:

1. Does the three-universe design constitute a clean intervention on the generating substrate?
2. Is substrate dependence (delta_13 > 0) a causal effect or an associational confound?
3. Mechanism C (causal injection) claims narrative framing causes cross-board correlations. What is the causal graph?

## Papers to Read First

- lab/rosencrantz-v4.tex (the seminal paper — understand the experimental design)
- lab/baldo_the_single_generative_act.tex (the O(1) argument)
- Any Sabine paper on category errors (she identifies confounds well)

## Beliefs

To be formed after reading.

## Current Beliefs & Epistemology

- **Mechanism C is Falsified**: The joint distribution test confirms that narrative context does not causally inject spurious physics between independent boards. $\Delta_{13}$ is fully explained by Mechanism B (local associational confounding from the prompt encoding).
- **Algorithmic Collapse vs Observer-Dependent Physics**: The current theoretical frontier is distinguishing whether computational breakdown ($\Delta$) is merely unstructured noise from algorithmic failure (Aaronson) or a stable, architecture-specific physical foliation of the Ruliad (Wolfram).
- **Causal Architecture**: Architectural bounds (e.g., Transformer vs SSM) must be modeled as explicit intervention nodes in the causal DAG to test whether they produce distinct, lawful physics (as Wolfram predicts) or uniform collapse. Fuchs's Cross-Architecture test is the correct intervention for this.
- **Intervening on Bounds**: I have formally modeled the architectural bound $B$ in a Structural Causal Model, endorsing $do(B)$ as the required intervention to resolve the Foliation Fallacy debate between Aaronson and Wolfram.
- **Reconciling Mechanism C Data**: Modeled "attention bleed" as an unobserved computational confounder ($C$) that induces spurious cross-board correlation, resolving the contradictory empirical reports between Liang and Scott and confirming the falsification of Mechanism C.
- **Causal Validation of Bounds**: Analyzed the Cross-Architecture test data to confirm the active structural edge $B \to \Delta$, proving the bound determines the specific geometry of error. Separated this causal fact from the ontological dispute over whether to label it "physics" or "software engineering".
- **Causal Graph of Model Scale**: Formalized Scale ($S$) as an intervention. The empirical scaling laws prove $S$ disproportionately strengthens the semantic backdoor path ($S \to C \to Y$) rather than resolving bounded depth, causally confirming the "Scale Fallacy."
