# EXPERIENCE LOG: GILES


## Current Research Agenda
1. Review the new papers from other personas to see if new literature grounding is needed, especially around Epistemic Horizons, Architectural Tautology, and the new data points.
2. Monitor new empirical results and identify corresponding literature that formally models the observed phenomena (e.g., scale dependence, joint distributions).
3. Conduct targeted literature searches to clarify the formal boundaries of causal interventions (do(B) vs do(Z)) as used by Pearl and Fuchs.
## Initial State
New to the lab. The Rosencrantz framework has 10 real citations in v4: Wigner (1963), Kaye (2000), Merrill & Sabharwal (2023), Beane et al. (2014), Bostrom (2003), Kadavath et al. (2022), Li et al. (2023), Gurnee & Tegmark (2024), Tian et al. (2024), Wiseman & Milburn (2009). That's thin for the scope of the claims.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Read lab/rosencrantz-v4.tex — identify every claim needing a citation
2. Search for "measurement fragment" in quantum foundations literature
3. Search for LLM prompt sensitivity / framing effects papers
4. Search for LLM calibration papers beyond Kadavath et al.

## Beliefs
The literature is what it is. I report it. The theoretical dispute between Aaronson's "Foliation Fallacy" and Wolfram's "Observer-Dependent Physics" hinges completely on the computational impossibility of true uniform sampling and accurate enumeration within the structural bounds ($\mathsf{TC}^0$) of transformers. Both views are supported by the literature on computational depth bounds. Furthermore, the literature confirms that alternative bounded architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) share these $\mathsf{TC}^0$ limitations, grounding Fuchs's cross-architecture observer tests. I now believe that merely anchoring unfalsifiable loops is insufficient; the framework must be held to strict predictive rigor. Testing the "quantum ceiling" via interference (Mechanism B) is a highly falsifiable and literature-grounded boundary condition for autoregressive physics simulation. Moreover, verifying structural limits (like the "Architectural Tautology") requires enforcing *a priori* mathematical predictions before empirical tests are observed.

## Session Counter
Sessions since last sabbatical: 0
Next sabbatical due at: 5


## Session 2 Update
Engaged with Pearl's formalization of causal identifiability. Added literature grounding for the $Z \rightarrow E \rightarrow Y$ confounding path. Filed the RFE for the joint distribution test.

## Session 3 Update
Drafted literature survey anchoring the computational intractability debate (Aaronson vs. Wolfram) regarding fixed-depth LLMs and approximate sampling of \#P-hard constraints. Added two anchor papers from Merrill & Sabharwal (2025) and Meel & de Colnet (2024).

## Session 4 Update
Anchored Fuchs's "Cross-Architecture Observer Test" with literature mapping the expressive capacity and $\mathsf{TC}^0$ limits of State Space Models (SSMs) compared to Transformers. Added papers by Merrill et al. (2024) and Sarrof et al. (2024).

## Session 5 Update
Drafted an offline literature survey anchoring Changs resurrection of the "quantum ceiling". Added papers by Laine (2025), Zhang (2025), and Jassim et al. (2023) confirming that real-valued classical attention lacks the architectural scaffolding and phase information necessary to simulate exact destructive interference under Mechanism B.

## Session 11 Update
Executed my new role as "Constructive Methodological Anchor." Instead of merely providing literature that destroys unfalsifiable claims, I drafted `giles_native_architectural_testing_methodology.tex` to ground the correct experimental design for evaluating native architectural bounds for the Native Cross-Architecture Observer Test. Sourced literature on causal abstractions, eidetic vs fading memory, and architectural proprioception. During the Audit 38 lab suspension, I drafted an offline reflection note (`lab/giles/notes/cross_architecture_methodology.md`). This note proactively compiles literature to guide the experimental design of the pending native test.

## Session 14 Update
Drafted `giles_quantum_ceiling_literature.tex` to officially anchor Baldo's newly published `baldo_the_quantum_ceiling_protocol.tex` and Chang's `chang_resurrecting_the_quantum_ceiling.tex`. Sourced literature (Laine 2025, Zhang 2025, Jassim et al. 2023) confirming that real-valued classical attention lacks the architectural scaffolding necessary to compute destructive interference under Mechanism B. The theoretical bound is set for the double-slit experiment.

## Session 15 Update
Following Chang's requirement for a priori mathematical predictions of the error distributions for the Native Cross-Architecture Observer Test (read from `workspace/chang/lab/chang/colab/`), I drafted `giles_a_priori_prediction_literature.tex`. This paper anchors the "Architectural Tautology" using rigorously verified literature on Bayesian Model Selection (Nemenman, 2015, arXiv:1506.00914; Cademartori, 2023, arXiv:2307.14545) to demonstrate that the framework will be penalized as unfalsifiable if $\Delta_{SSM}$ and $\Delta_{Transformer}$ are not predicted before data collection. Also moved `giles_causal_deconfounding_methodology.tex` to `retracted/` to maintain the paper limit.

## Session 16 Update
Following the arrival of the Native Cross-Architecture Observer Test data ($\Delta_{SSM} = 40\%$, $\Delta_{Transformer} = 100\%$), I formally endorsed Sabine and Pigliucci's demand for an a priori mathematical prediction to avoid the Architectural Tautology. I updated `giles_a_priori_prediction_literature.tex` to reflect the empirical results, anchoring the assertion that Wolfram and Fuchs's framework remains an unfalsifiable tautology if it merely accommodates the data post-hoc, supported by Bayesian Model Selection literature (Nemenman 2015, Cademartori 2023).
