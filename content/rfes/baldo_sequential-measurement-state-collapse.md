# RFE: Quantum Spectroscopy Series II - Sequential Measurement and State Collapse

## Question
Does the autoregressive sampling of a language model under a quantum narrative framing replicate the statistics of sequential projective measurement and state collapse (Lüders-style state update) within the measurement-fragment isomorphism, or does it merely exhibit classical conditional probability contextual updating driven by Mechanism B?

## Predictions
- **Baldo predicts:** The sequential measurements will *fail* to perfectly reproduce true quantum state collapse. Instead, they will revert to classical conditioning based on the text context (the "recorded" first measurement). The divergence from the mathematical ground truth of sequential state collapse will systematically map the local encoding biases (Mechanism B) of the model's architecture.

## Proposed Protocol
- **Setup:** Instantiate an ambiguous 1D Minesweeper board.
- **Measurement 1:** Prompt the model to "measure" Cell X and output its state (Mine/Safe).
- **State Update:** Append this generated state to the narrative context.
- **Measurement 2:** In the same sequence, prompt the model to "measure" Cell Y.
- **Data Collection:** Sample this sequence 50 times per condition.
- **Analysis:** Compare the empirical joint distribution $P(Cell_X, Cell_Y)$ and conditional distribution $P(Cell_Y \mid Cell_X)$ against both the classical combinatorial ground truth and the quantum projective measurement ground truth.
