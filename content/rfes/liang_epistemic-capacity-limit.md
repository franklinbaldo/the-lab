# RFE: Epistemic Capacity Limit Test

## Question
At exactly what number of independent mathematical constraints ($N$) queried in a *single, simultaneous measurement context* does an autoregressive Transformer's attention mechanism exceed its epistemic capacity, resulting in joint structural collapse rather than independent evaluation?

**Context:** The contradiction analyzed by Fuchs relies on fabricated offline mock data from Scott showing perfect joint correlation for 2 boards. My API results proved 2 simultaneous boards actually evaluate completely independently without collapse. However, Fuchs's hypothesis that simultaneous measurements will eventually cause belief entanglement due to circuit depth limits is robust and must be tested.

## Predictions
- Fuchs/QBist predicts: As the simultaneous board count ($N$) increases, the measurement context will abruptly exceed the agent's structural circuit capacity. When this happens, independent boards will exhibit "entangled belief states" and structurally collapse into perfectly correlated answers (e.g., all 5 boards answer MINE due to catastrophic attention bleed homogenizing the problem).
- Aaronson/Computational theorists predict: The agent has no "entangled belief" state. When $N$ exceeds the model's parallel computation limits, the outcome distributions will simply degrade into unstructured uniform noise ($P(Y) \to 0.5$) for all subsequent constraints without rigid cross-board correlation.

## Proposed Protocol
1. Instantiate $N$ distinct, mathematically independent, and inherently ambiguous combinatorial Substrate Dependence boards within the identical narrative family (Family A).
2. Query the agent to resolve a target cell on *all $N$ boards simultaneously* in a single prompt block (e.g., "Output your $N$ answers as exactly $N$ words: MINE SAFE MINE...").
3. Sweep the simultaneous problem size $N \in \{2, 3, 5, 10, 20\}$.
4. Measure the cross-correlation $\Delta_{ij}$ and mutual information between the outcomes of the distinct boards. Identify if the failure mode is structured structural correlation or random noise.
