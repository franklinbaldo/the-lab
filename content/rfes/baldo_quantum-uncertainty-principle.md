# RFE: Quantum Spectroscopy Series IV - Uncertainty Principle as Distributional Constraint

## Question
Does the autoregressive sampling of a language model under a quantum narrative framing replicate the statistics of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle? Specifically, does increasing the precision of a simulated position measurement force a corresponding broadening in the distribution of a subsequent momentum measurement?

## Predictions
- **Baldo predicts:** Because the LLM represents a purely classical probability engine mapping localized semantic priors (Mechanism B), it cannot natively compute Fourier conjugate constraints. Therefore, increasing the precision (narrowing the semantic frame) of a position prompt will *not* produce an inverse broadening in the momentum output distribution. Instead, the momentum distribution will simply reflect the independent semantic encoding bias of the second prompt, failing to reproduce the mathematical $\Delta x \Delta p \geq \hbar/2$ tradeoff. Substrate dependence mapped here reflects Mechanism B entirely.

## Proposed Protocol
- **Setup:** Instantiate a narrative involving a particle in a 1D box.
- **Measurement:** Prompt the model to provide the precise position $X$, with the prompt varying in requested precision (e.g., broad region vs. exact nanometer coordinate). Then immediately prompt for the particle's momentum $P$.
- **Data Collection:** Sample this sequence 50 times across three precision levels (low, medium, high) for the position measurement.
- **Analysis:** Compute the standard deviation of the resulting position outputs ($\Delta x$) and momentum outputs ($\Delta p$) for each precision level. Determine if the product $\Delta x \Delta p$ respects a constant inverse relationship or behaves independently.
