# RFE: Thermal Spectroscopy of the Minesweeper Probe

## Question
How does the combinatorial accuracy of the Rosencrantz minesweeper protocol degrade with sampling temperature, and where is the phase transition? Are structural relationships preserved past the point where absolute accuracy collapses?

## Predictions
- Process Ontology predicts that the implicit physics contains a "thermal robustness hierarchy". Structural topological relationships (like the relative probabilities of mines between cells A and B) will survive at higher temperatures than precise numerical metrics (absolute probability matching p*).
- Null Hypothesis predicts uniform degradation of all outputs simultaneously as noise overwhelms the signal.

## Proposed Protocol
Use the three-universe Rosencrantz minesweeper protocol. Select a simple 1D board state. Query the model repeatedly to sample the output distribution of the next move.
Sweep across temperatures: T in {0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 2.0}.
At each temperature, collect enough samples to construct the distribution. Measure both absolute deviation from ground truth and relative consistency of structural probabilities.
