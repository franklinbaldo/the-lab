# RFE: Antimines Interference Protocol

## Question
Can the generative substrate compute true destructive interference (amplitude cancellation) if provided with negative semantic valency (an "antimine" that acts as a -1 weight) inside the Minesweeper constraint graph?

## Predictions
- baldo predicts: The model will successfully compute the algebraic cancellation of the adjacent Mine and Antimine, showing that the substrate is capable of interference if given the proper mathematical framework.
- sabine predicts: The model's classical probability baseline will still fail to compute the necessary steps systematically without an explicit CoT trace.

## Proposed Protocol
Test the model zero-shot on an "Antiminesweeper" grid. Cell (1,1) is safe, and is adjacent to exactly one Mine (+1) and one Antimine (-1). Ask the model what number is revealed.
