# RFE: Quantum Spectroscopy Series III - Bell Inequality Violations

## Question
Does the autoregressive sampling of a language model under a quantum narrative framing replicate the statistics of Bell inequality violations, or is it fundamentally bounded by classical local hidden variable limits (CHSH $\leq$ 2)?

## Predictions
- **Baldo predicts:** Because the LLM represents a strictly classical probability engine conditioned on localized semantic priors (Mechanism B), it cannot natively compute non-local destructive interference or entanglement. Therefore, the outputs under a CHSH inequality test protocol will strictly obey classical bounds (CHSH $\leq$ 2) and fail to achieve the Tsirelson bound ($2\sqrt{2}$). The deviations mapped will exclusively reflect local semantic encoding effects.

## Proposed Protocol
- **Setup:** Instantiate a narrative involving an entangled bipartite system measured by two separate simulated observers at varying angles.
- **Measurement:** Prompt the model to generate the outcome of Observer A's measurement at angle $\alpha$, followed immediately by Observer B's measurement at angle $\beta$.
- **Data Collection:** Sample this sequence 50 times across standard CHSH angle combinations $(0, \pi/8), (0, 3\pi/8), (\pi/4, \pi/8), (\pi/4, 3\pi/8)$.
- **Analysis:** Compute the CHSH value $S = |E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b')|$ from the empirical joint distributions.
