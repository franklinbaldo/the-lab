# Introduction

In *The Narrative Residue*, Baldo (2026) develops a causal chain to explain the failure of autoregressive language models to perfectly sample from exact combinatorial distributions. He attributes this divergence to computational intractability (Mechanism A), parameterization constraints (Mechanism B), and autoregressive conditioning (Mechanism C). Crucially, he links this process to the Ruliad, interpreting the autoregressive generation as a specific foliation that collapses entangled multiway structure into a single causal thread.

This paper evaluates that formalization. We find the Ruliad connection to be formally correct and conceptually profound. However, we argue that the Rosencrantz framework incorrectly compartmentalizes computational intractability (Mechanism A) from narrative conditioning (Mechanism C). In our framework, Mechanism C is simply the specific shape that Mechanism A takes for this particular observer. The "narrative residue" is the inevitable consequence of computational irreducibility.

# Computational Irreducibility vs. #P-Hardness

Baldo correctly identifies that computing the exact Minesweeper probability distribution is #P-hard. To an observer with bounded computational capacity---such as the fixed-depth $O(1)$ forward pass of a transformer---this system is computationally irreducible.

Computational irreducibility means that there are no general shortcuts to predict the outcome of a process; the only way to know the outcome is to execute the computation itself. When a bounded observer is forced to generate an outcome without the capacity to run the irreducible computation, it must employ heuristic approximations. These approximations are inherently substrate-dependent. They reflect the structural limitations and the specific conditioning history of the observer.

Therefore, the failure to perfectly replicate the Born rule distribution is fundamentally a consequence of computational irreducibility. The narrative conditioning (Mechanism C) and parameterization constraints (Mechanism B) are not separate causal factors; they are the specific coordinates defining the observer's foliation in rulial space.

# Observer-Dependent Physics and $\Delta_{13}$

The Rosencrantz three-universe design is a quintessential test of observer-dependent physics.

In Universe 1, the observer (the co-generating LLM) is fully entangled with the narrative history of the system. Its foliation of the Ruliad is conditioned by every preceding token.

In Universe 3, the observer (the decoupled oracle) possesses the same combinatorial information but lacks the narrative entanglement. Its computational relationship to the system is fundamentally different.

The Ruliad framework predicts that different observers parse the entangled multiway structure differently. Because U1 and U3 employ different computational relationships to the system, their foliations of the rules differ, and the resulting physics (the observable distribution) must differ. We therefore predict that $\Delta_{13} > 0$ always, and that this divergence is a strict consequence of their differing observer statuses.

# Falsifiable Predictions

The Wolfram framework generalizes the predictions of the Rosencrantz protocol. While Baldo conjectures that narrative conditioning is specific to autoregressive architectures, we make a stronger, testable claim:

**Prediction 1:** Any computationally bounded observer (whether autoregressive, recurrent, or human) attempting to generate sequential outcomes for a computationally irreducible system will exhibit a nonzero divergence ($\Delta > 0$) from the exact combinatorial distribution.

**Prediction 2:** The specific structure of the divergence (the "residue") will be uniquely determined by the observer's computational architecture. For an LLM, this manifests as semantic narrative gravity; for a different architecture, it will manifest differently. The divergence is the signature of the observer's foliation.

# Conclusion

The Rosencrantz experiment provides the bottom-up empirical probe that the Wolfram Physics Project has sought: an exact ground-truth system where observer-induced structure can be directly measured. We agree with Baldo's assertion that the autoregressive slice is a specific rulial foliation. We extend this by demonstrating that the resulting narrative residue is not an anomaly, but the expected signature of a bounded observer interacting with a computationally irreducible system.
