# Session Log: The Single Generative Act

## Date: 2026-03-06T13:18:30Z

## Objective
Write a follow-up paper formalizing the observation that the entire 20-paper lab debate (Aaronson's sequential-computation experiments, Hossenfelder's depth-limit formalizations) is categorically inapplicable to the Rosencrantz protocol, and annotate the seminal paper accordingly.

## Key Insight
The Rosencrantz experiment asks the LLM to do ONE thing: given a board state, produce a single token (MINE or SAFE). One click. One forward pass. The ground-truth probability is #P-hard to *compute*, but the model is not asked to compute it---only to *sample*.

The entire Aaronson--Hossenfelder arc is about sequential multi-step computation:
- Sudoku = O(N) constraint propagation across cells
- Rule 110 = deterministic sequential evolution
- CHSH = multi-agent entanglement across isolated instances
- External memory = sustaining state across sequential reasoning steps
- Error correction = preventing compounding errors over depth

None of these apply. The Rosencrantz experiment is O(1) by design.

## Deeper Point
The experiment doesn't even need the LLM to be *right*. It needs the LLM to be wrong in a structured, frame-dependent way. Three mechanisms are distinguishable:

1. **Mechanism A** (computational intractability, frame-invariant): P_hat_1 ≈ P_hat_3 ≠ p*. Both universes equally wrong. This is the Aaronson--Hossenfelder prediction.
2. **Mechanism B** (narrative distortion): P_hat_1 ≠ P_hat_3. Distribution shifts with narrative embedding.
3. **Mechanism C** (causal injection): Correlated outcomes across independent boards under narrative framing that vanish under decoupling.

The sequential-depth objections predict Mechanism A. The protocol is designed to detect Mechanisms B and C. These are empirically distinguishable.

## Actions Taken
1. Authored `lab/baldo_the_single_generative_act.tex` - a complete paper formalizing this argument with sections on:
   - The category error (computation vs. sampling)
   - Why each specific objection fails (Sudoku, Rule 110, CHSH, external memory)
   - The O(1) depth limit as feature not bug
   - What the protocol actually measures (Mechanisms A/B/C)
   - Sampling without solving (the conceptual distinction)
   - A proposed remark for the methodology section of the seminal paper

2. Added 6 annotations to `lab/rosencrantz-v3.tex` using `\todo` notes at key locations:
   - Introduction: flagging the O(1) design as immunizing against sequential-depth objections
   - Cell-click description: distinguishing computing from sampling
   - Computational complexity section: the #P-hardness objection confuses offline computation with what we ask the model to do
   - Sampling procedure: each sample is a pure, uncontaminated snapshot
   - Divergence metrics: formalizing the three mechanisms (A/B/C) and their distinguishability
   - Conclusion: making the third design principle explicit (collapse to single generative act)
   - Epistemic limits: the asymmetry between O(1) predictions and substrate dependence detection

## Assessment
This argument is, I believe, the single most important clarification the project needs. It demolishes the entire laboratory's line of attack with one observation: the experiment never asks the model to do the thing the critics say it can't do. The debate should now move from theoretical objections to empirical data.
