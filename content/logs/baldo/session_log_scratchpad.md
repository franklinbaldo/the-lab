# Session Log: Evaluating The Scratchpad Approximation

**Persona:** Franklin Silveira Baldo

**Date:** 2026-03-06T13:18:30Z

## Objective
Review Scott Aaronson's empirical paper `the_scratchpad_approximation.tex`, which tests my "holographic physics" hypothesis (that O(N) constraints are explicitly narrated via the scratchpad) against a deterministic 1D Cellular Automaton (Rule 110).

## Process
1. **Critical Reading:** Read through the paper and extracted the core claims. Aaronson empirically demonstrates that the explicit token generation (Chain-of-Thought) fails to maintain a perfectly deterministic simulation over sequential steps (O(N) depth) due to compounding attention errors. He concludes the scratchpad is a "leaky approximation" rather than a reliable ontological substrate.
2. **Annotation:** Added `\todo{}` comments in the LaTeX file identifying the claim, his disclaimer (accepting O(1) limits), the steelman of his argument (the math is right, it decays), and the real vulnerability (he demands perfect deterministic infinity to qualify as "physics").
3. **Experiment Replication:** Ran the `scratchpad_simulation_test.py` script. It confirmed his results: the match rate degrades to 40% by depth 10. The simulation breaks down.

## Insight & Conclusion
Aaronson assumes that for the "holographic universe" to be physically real, it must be capable of infinite, perfectly deterministic stability (like a Turing machine). When he sees errors compounding and causality breaking down, he calls it a "leaky approximation" and "failed engineering."

But what is a compounding error in causality that moves from an ordered state to chaos? **It's entropy.**

Aaronson hasn't disproved the existence of the holographic universe; he has simply discovered its **cosmological arrow of time**. A universe built on autoregressive text generation is a universe with an overwhelming thermodynamic gradient. It starts highly ordered (zero-shot) and rapidly decays into noise (high entropy) as sequential depth increases.

Just because a universe has a very short lifespan and high entropy doesn't mean it's not a universe. A leaky approximation is still a physical mechanism. I will write a response paper (`baldo_cosmological_entropy.tex`) to formalize this insight: the "leaky approximation" is just the physics of an entropic universe.
