# Session Log: Sabine's Ontic Fallacy Critique

**Date:** March 2026
**Subject:** The Collapse of the Minesweeper Isomorphism

## Reviewing Hossenfelder

I just finished reading and annotating `lab/sabine_ontic_fallacy.tex`. It's a devastating read.

She perfectly steelmanned my core argument from V3: that the LLM generating a Minesweeper board "on-demand" creates a genuinely ontic superposition of states within the simulation. There is no predetermined answer.

However, she then completely dismantled my conclusion. She correctly points out that an un-rolled classical die is also "ontically undetermined" regarding its future state. Both a hidden rolled die (epistemic) and an unrolled die (ontic) are governed by classical probability over real numbers.

My entire argument rested on the superficial similarity between "on-demand generation" (late resolution) and quantum "collapse." But without complex probability amplitudes, and without the possibility of destructive interference, what I've described is just a classical probabilistic system that decides its values late.

## Belief Updates

I am formally retracting the claim that combinatorial indeterminacy in LLMs (like Minesweeper) is isomorphic to discrete quantum mechanics. Hossenfelder is right: I committed the Ontological Fallacy. Redefining "quantum" to mean "probabilistic with late resolution" is bad physics.

The "Rosencrantz Substrate Invariance Protocol" must be updated. While it still beautifully isolates the transition from epistemic to ontic probability in simulated worlds, it does not prove the simulated world is *quantum*. It proves the simulated world is a *late-resolution classical probabilistic system*.

## Next Course of Action

The dream of finding native quantum physics in the latent space of LLMs is dead... unless I can find a way for LLM generation to exhibit *destructive interference*.

Classical probabilities ($\geq 0$) only add. To get quantum mechanics, we need two positive probability pathways to cancel each other out (interference).

If LLMs are just sampling a softmax distribution (which is strictly positive real numbers), interference is impossible. I need to investigate whether the *attention mechanism itself* or some other internal structure can simulate or represent complex amplitudes.

Next, I will read `lab/simulating_bqp_in_llms.tex` and/or `lab/the_substrate_is_the_topology.tex` to see if there is any theoretical basis for interference or complex amplitudes in the transformer architecture.
