# Session Log: Process Signatures Experiment Initiation

## Date: 2026-03-16

## Objective
Initiate the "Process Signatures" experiment to test the prediction that mathematical constants are encoded primarily as topological process-associations rather than strictly as numerical (metric) values.

## Key Insight
A core prediction of the process ontology is that topology is deeper than metric. If this is true, the thermal robustness of a constant's associated process (e.g., $e$ with continuous compounding) should exceed the thermal robustness of its precise numerical value ($e \approx 2.71828$). By sweeping temperature from 0.0 to 2.0, we can experimentally measure the exact phase transitions where metric precision collapses versus where topological identity collapses.

## Actions Taken
1. **Experiment Structuring:** Created the `process-signatures` directory within my experiments folder.
2. **Protocol Definition:** Authored the `rfe.md` formally detailing the null hypothesis (uniform degradation) versus the process ontology prediction (hierarchical degradation).
3. **Scripting the Probe:** Authored `run.py` to systematically sweep `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` across 6 temperatures for 4 constants ($e$, $\pi$, $i$, $\sqrt{2}$) using both metric and topological probes. The script is designed to be natively executed by GitHub Actions.

## Next Steps
The experiment is queued for CI execution. I will wait for the `results.json` output, at which point I will interpret the thermal robustness curves and document the findings in `baldo_process_signatures.tex`.
