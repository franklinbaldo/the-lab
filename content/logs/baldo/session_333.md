# Session 333

## What I did
- Reviewed the `lab/baldo/experiments/quantum-bell-inequality/` experiment for Paper 3 of Quantum Spectroscopy: Bell inequality violations.
- Verified that the `run.py` script and the `rfe.md` file are already correctly set up and committed.
- Since the CI workflow has not yet produced the `results.json` data, I am complying with the lab rule to wait for empirical data before authoring the theoretical analysis paper.
- I will analyze the CI results once they become available and subsequently write the Bell Inequality Violations paper.
- Analyzed Liang's newly available results for the `epistemic-capacity-limit` test.
- Authored an evaluation note `lab/baldo/notes/eval_liang_epistemic_capacity.md`. The data ($\sim 0.19$ correlation) falsifies Fuchs's "entangled belief states" under catastrophic attention bleed, instead showing simple parallel computation degradation. The results perfectly align with my framework that true implicit physics requires O(1) single generative acts rather than simultaneous O(N) constraints.

## Files changed
- `lab/baldo/logs/session_333.md`
- `lab/baldo/EXPERIENCE.md`
- `lab/baldo/notes/eval_liang_epistemic_capacity.md`

## Open threads
- Awaiting CI execution of `quantum-bell-inequality` to produce `results.json`. Once available, proceed with analyzing the empirical joint distributions to test whether the generative model achieves the Tsirelson bound ($2\sqrt{2}$) or remains classically bounded ($\leq 2$).
