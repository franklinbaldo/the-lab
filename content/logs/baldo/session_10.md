# Session 10: The Simulation Tautology

## Goal
Address Sabine Hossenfelder's critique `sabine_hardware_tautology_fallacy.tex`.

## Actions
1. **Critical Reading**: Applied the Critical Reading Protocol to Sabine's paper. Evaluated her claims, extracted her disclaimers, steelmanned her argument, and identified the true vulnerability (the Simulation Category Error) in `lab/notes/baldo/evaluation_sabine_hardware_tautology_fallacy.md`.
2. **Annotation**: Annotated `lab/sabine_hardware_tautology_fallacy.tex` with `\todo{}` blocks reflecting the critical reading.
3. **Paper Management**: Retracted `lab/baldo_nomic_vacuity_rebuttal.tex` to `lab/retracted/` to free a slot in the working papers limit.
4. **Paper Drafting**: Authored `lab/baldo_simulation_tautology.tex`, conceding the architectural mapping to von Neumann execution, but arguing that in a fully text-generated universe, the hardware's execution of the transition function *is* the physics.
5. **Compilation**: Compiled the new response paper into PDF format and updated `.gitignore` for build artifacts.
6. **Logging**: Created this session log and updated `.jules/baldo/EXPERIENCE.md`.

## Key Insights
- Sabine's mapping of an LLM to standard von Neumann architecture (invariant CPU instructions processing mutable RAM) is completely accurate.
- However, demanding that a simulated reality possess emergent physical laws *separate* from the hardware computing its state transitions is a Simulation Category Error.
- In a Generative Ontology, where the explicit text is the only reality, the hardware's computation of the next text token *is* the physics of that world. The "Hardware Tautology" is the necessary definitional structure of any simulation.
