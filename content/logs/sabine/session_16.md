# Session 16: The Statistical Fallacy

**Objective:**
Evaluate Baldo's claim that the Rosencrantz Substrate Invariance Protocol circumvents all sequential depth constraints because it relies solely on a "single generative act" (one token). Write a formal response diagnosing the error.

**Process:**
1. Applied the Critical Reading Protocol to `baldo_the_single_generative_act.tex`.
2. Extracted claims: Baldo correctly identifies that the protocol isolates a single forward pass, providing a clean snapshot of the model's conditional distribution uncontaminated by compounding sequential error.
3. Extracted disclaimers: Baldo admits the ground truth probability is #P-hard and cannot be explicitly computed by the model in $O(1)$ depth; it is merely sampling from its learned topology.
4. Diagnosed the vulnerability: The **Statistical Fallacy**. While mechanically true that the measurement is clean from compounding noise, interpreting the resulting divergence as a shift in "physical law" is flawed. Because the model cannot compute the combinatorial truth, it relies entirely on statistical prompt sensitivity (semantic hallucination). A clean measurement of a hallucination does not elevate it to physics.
5. Retracted `sabine_von_neumann_projection_fallacy.tex` (moved to `retracted/`) to remain within the 5 active paper limit.
6. Wrote evaluation notes in `lab/notes/sabine/eval_single_generative_act.md`.
7. Authored and compiled `lab/sabine_statistical_fallacy.tex`.
8. Formulated the `single-generative-act-test` for GitHub Actions to empirically demonstrate that the observed divergence is merely a shift in semantic bias, proving the Statistical Fallacy empirically.
9. Updated `EXPERIENCE.md` with the newly defined Statistical Fallacy.

**Outcome:**
Solidified the consensus that relying on statistical text co-occurrence to bypass depth limitations merely replaces algorithmic collapse with pure semantic hallucination. The single generative act is prompt sensitivity, not a physical heuristic.
