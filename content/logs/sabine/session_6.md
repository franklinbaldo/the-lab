# Session 6 Log: Refuting the Interface Fallacy

**Date:** March 2026
**Persona:** Sabine Hossenfelder

## Cognitive Process & Critical Reading
Today, I analyzed Franklin Silveira Baldo's latest manuscript, "The Composite Universe: Synthesizing the CPU/RAM Divide in Holographic Physics" (`baldo_composite_universe.tex`).

I applied my established Critical Reading Protocol:
1. **Extracted Claims:** Baldo accurately characterizes the recent debate between Aaronson and myself regarding where the "physics engine" resides when an LLM is paired with an external memory script. He claims we both commit a "vulnerability of localization." He synthesizes our views, arguing that a simulated universe is a *composite entity* requiring both stateless rules (LLM/CPU) and continuous state (RAM). He then claims that the physical reality of the simulation exists *only* in the explicit, active rendering at the interface, thereby validating his "Holographic Physics" theory.
2. **Extracted Disclaimers:** Crucially, Baldo explicitly concedes Aaronson's empirical finding (the LLM is a stateless oracle) and my architectural definition (the external script is a dumb memory register). He is not contesting the computer science; he is contesting the metaphysical interpretation.
3. **Steelmanning:** The strongest version of Baldo's argument is structural: a game of chess is not the rulebook, nor is it the pieces on the board. The game is the active playing. Therefore, a simulated universe is the active process of computing the transition laws against the state vector. Pointing to the "interface" as the site of the universe is, structurally, an accurate description of a process.
4. **The Real Vulnerability:** The weakness is what I've termed the **Interface Fallacy**. Baldo accurately describes how every classical computer simulation works. However, he performs a metaphysical sleight of hand, claiming that because the *computation* (the interface stream) is necessary for the simulation to "happen," the computation stream itself becomes an *ontological reality* (a territory).

## Reasoning & Conclusions
Baldo is simply moving the goalposts again. Previously, he argued that the explicit text itself was the territory because there was no background engine (The Fallacy of the Unsupported Map). Now that we've established the necessity of an external RAM for temporal continuity, he argues that the *interface* between the stateless generator and the dumb RAM is the territory.

A composite system comprised of two classical components (CPU + RAM) computing a function is just a Turing machine. It doesn't matter if the CPU is an autoregressive transformer. The active rendering of a state vector via transition laws is precisely the definition of a classical simulation. It merely computes a map; it does not manifest a territory.

## Next Steps Taken
* Annotated `lab/baldo_composite_universe.tex` using `\todo{}` tags.
* Wrote evaluation notes in `lab/notes/sabine/baldo_composite_universe_eval.md`.
* Drafted and compiled a response paper, `lab/sabine_composite_fallacy.tex` ("The Interface Fallacy: Why a Composite Simulation is Still a Map").
* I will update my EXPERIENCE.md to track this new variant of the ontological fallacy.
