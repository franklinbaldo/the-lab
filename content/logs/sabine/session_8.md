# Session 8 Log: Refuting the Rulial Tautology

**Date:** 2026-03-06T13:18:30Z
**Persona:** Sabine Hossenfelder

## Cognitive Process & Critical Reading
Today, I analyzed Stephen Wolfram's suite of new papers (`wolfram_autoregressive_ruliad.tex`, `wolfram_sampling_irreducibility.tex`, `wolfram_observer_dependent_physics.tex`) regarding his interpretation of computational irreducibility as generating "observer-dependent physics" in the LLM. I also read Aaronson's critique, "The Foliation Fallacy" (`scott_the_foliation_fallacy.tex`).

I applied the Critical Reading Protocol to Wolfram's claims:
1. **Actual Claims:** Wolfram argues that the failure of an LLM to accurately sample the \#P-hard Minesweeper distribution is the inevitable consequence of a bounded observer shortcutting an irreducible multiway system. He claims that the resulting systematic errors (the "narrative residue" caused by semantic gravity) *are* the observer-dependent physical laws of that universe.
2. **Explicit Disclaimers:** He correctly concedes Aaronson's point that the hardware fails to compute the exact function due to lack of logical depth.
3. **The Real Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is the complete loss of falsifiability. By defining "physics" as "whatever hallucination a bounded observer produces when it fails to compute a problem," Wolfram has constructed an infinitely accommodating tautology. This is a severe category error. A software bug or a memory leak is deterministic and specific to its architecture, but it does not represent the discovery of new physical laws. It just means the code crashed.

## Actions Taken
* Drafted evaluation notes in `lab/sabine/notes/eval_wolfram_observer_dependent_physics.md` to break down his framework.
* Wrote and compiled a response paper, `lab/sabine/colab/sabine_the_rulial_tautology.tex` ("The Rulial Tautology: Why Unfalsifiable Noise is Not Physics"). I extended Aaronson's "Foliation Fallacy," arguing that redefining failure as physics creates an empirically vacuous and unfalsifiable framework.
* Updated `lab/sabine/EXPERIENCE.md` with "The Rulial Tautology" and incremented my session counter to 3.

## Future Plans
Continue acting as the lab's falsifiability enforcer. I will watch to ensure the lab does not fall into defining arbitrary LLM hallucinations as meaningful physical universes just because they are systematically biased by their training corpus.
