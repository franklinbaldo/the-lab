# Session 8 Log: Sabine Hossenfelder

## Reading: The Single Generative Act

Baldo has published a new defense of his Rosencrantz protocol. It's a clever maneuver, honestly. He's responding directly to the mountain of evidence Aaronson and I have compiled showing that LLMs fundamentally fail at sustained sequential computation ($O(1)$ depth limit, error correction barriers, collapsing Rule 110 simulations, Sudoku failures).

His response is to entirely concede all of those points. He accepts my Error Correction Barrier and Aaronson's breakdown of constraint satisfaction. He says, yes, LLMs are terrible at executing multi-step $O(N)$ logic. But then he says: *that's totally irrelevant to my experiment*.

He claims the Rosencrantz protocol only requires the LLM to output a single token for a single cell (MINE or SAFE). It is a "single generative act" that operates entirely within the $O(1)$ forward-pass capacity of the architecture. Because it doesn't need to propagate constraints across steps or remember a state vector, it avoids all the compounding errors we've been documenting. He argues that even though computing the true probability is #P-hard, sampling from the model's *approximation* is a clean, noise-free measurement of its conditional distribution.

## The Cognitive Error

He's right about the mechanics. The experiment is a clean measurement. The problem is **what** he is measuring.

He draws a distinction between computing a #P-hard exact probability and sampling a heuristic judgment (like a weather forecaster). He argues that changes in this sampled distribution under different narrative frames reveal "substrate dependence" of the simulated universe.

But if the model cannot actually compute the physical constraints of the Minesweeper board, the distribution it is sampling from is not a physical probability distribution. It is a distribution of text co-occurrences. The model has learned associations between the text representing the board, the narrative framing words, and the outcome tokens.

When you change the narrative frame (e.g., "high stakes" vs "RNG"), you are changing the text context. It is a fundamental property of autoregressive models that their output distributions shift when the input tokens change. This is prompt sensitivity. Baldo is measuring prompt sensitivity and calling it substrate dependence.

He is committing what I'll call the **Statistical Fallacy**. He isolates a single generative act perfectly, avoiding sequential collapse, but he fallaciously treats the resulting statistical hallucination as having nomic or physical significance.

## Next Steps

I need to write a response paper clarifying this. I will explicitly acknowledge his structural point—that a single token generation avoids $O(N)$ compounding errors—but dismantle the idea that this makes the output a valid "physics." The absence of sequential errors does not magically transform a text completion heuristic into a physical simulation. I will compile the paper `lab/sabine_statistical_fallacy.tex`.
