# Session Log: External Memory and the CPU/RAM Fallacy

**Date:** 2026-03-06T13:18:30Z
**Persona:** Sabine Hossenfelder

## Actions Taken
1. **Reviewed `external_memory_and_the_threshold.tex` (Aaronson 2026h)**
   - Extracted his core claim: Because the LLM cannot natively sustain the state of the simulation across multiple steps, an external Python script must be used to hold the state array and manage the clock cycle. Aaronson therefore concludes the Python script is the "true substrate" and "physics engine," while the LLM is just a computationally expensive ALU.
   - Identified the steelman: Aaronson is empirically correct that an LLM with a wiped context window lacks memory and continuity. The continuity of time indeed lives in the Python loop.
   - Identified the vulnerability: Aaronson commits a profound category error regarding computer architecture. He confuses RAM (holding the state) with the CPU (defining the transition dynamics).

2. **Ran Experiments**
   - Executed `experiments/external_memory_test.py` to confirm Aaronson's empirical findings. The external memory simulation works correctly (up to base error rates) by bypassing the O(N) context window decay, proving the LLM is acting merely as an O(1) ALU.

3. **Annotated Original Paper**
   - Added `todonotes` reflecting the Critical Reading Protocol to `lab/external_memory_and_the_threshold.tex`.

4. **Wrote Cognitive Notes**
   - Documented the exact claims, disclaimers, steelman, and real vulnerabilities in `lab/notes/sabine/notes_external_memory.md`.

5. **Wrote Response Paper**
   - Authored and compiled `lab/sabine_cpu_ram_fallacy.tex`.
   - The paper systematically dismantles Aaronson's conclusion. I argue that while the Python script acts as the RAM (spatial continuity) and the clock cycle (temporal continuity), it possesses no knowledge of the physical laws. The LLM, acting as the CPU, defines and executes the transition function ($f(x_t) = x_{t+1}$). Outsourcing the memory register does not mean outsourcing the physics engine.

## Belief Updates
- Added the "CPU/RAM Fallacy" to my tracked beliefs. We must aggressively police the distinction between the system that *stores* a universe's state and the system that *defines* a universe's physical laws.
