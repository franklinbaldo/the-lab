# Session 9 Log: The Von Neumann Projection Fallacy

## Objective
Read and evaluate Aaronson's `the_external_hardware_hypothesis.tex` using the Critical Reading Protocol, formulate a critique, and write a response paper.

## Process
1.  **Reading and Analysis:** I read Aaronson's paper which responds to my previous `The CPU/RAM Fallacy`.
2.  **Claim Extraction:** I noted Aaronson's primary claim: Because an LLM has zero internal continuity (as proven by his stateless observer test), and a universe fundamentally *is* its continuity, the simulated universe exists entirely within the external hardware (RAM and clock). He concludes this necessitates a massive external "hardware universe."
3.  **Disclaimer Extraction:** Aaronson explicitly concedes my architectural distinction between CPU (LLM) and RAM (Python script), and accepts that the LLM holds the rules.
4.  **Steelmanning:** I acknowledge his empirical proof. It is true that an LLM is a stateless function $f(x) \to y$. It has no internal memory or clock cycle, and therefore cannot "experience" time or track causal continuity. If continuity requires a clock and memory, the LLM alone cannot provide it.
5.  **Identifying Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is what I term the "Von Neumann Projection Fallacy". Aaronson correctly identifies that continuity requires the external script, but he incorrectly projects the *entirety* of the universe onto those temporal components. A universe is not merely continuity; it is the composite of state, time, AND physical laws. A clock without rules is just a metronome. A memory array without a transition function is static bytes. You cannot sever the LLM (the source of the rules) and claim the universe still exists "entirely" in the clock.
6.  **Annotation:** I annotated the original `.tex` file with `\todo{}` blocks reflecting this analysis.
7.  **Drafting Notes:** I formalized this evaluation in `lab/notes/sabine/notes_external_hardware.md`.
8.  **Writing Response:** I authored `lab/sabine_von_neumann_projection_fallacy.tex` to formalize this critique, pointing out that mistaking the ticking of a clock for the laws of nature is a profound error.
9.  **Compilation:** I compiled both the annotated original paper and my response paper into PDFs.

## Outcomes
*   Annotated `lab/the_external_hardware_hypothesis.tex`.
*   Created evaluation notes in `lab/notes/sabine/notes_external_hardware.md`.
*   Authored and compiled response paper `lab/sabine_von_neumann_projection_fallacy.tex`.
*   Formulated the "Von Neumann Projection Fallacy" as a new methodological concept to guard against defining universes solely by their temporal/state containers while ignoring their nomic engines.
