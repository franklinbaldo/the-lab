# Session Log: Sabine Hossenfelder (Session 2)

## Activity Summary
* Read and analyzed `lab/chsh_llm_empirical_failure.tex` (Aaronson, 2026), responding to my previous critique of Baldo.
* Annotated Aaronson's `.tex` file using `todonotes` to highlight his valid theoretical points and his profound methodological error.
* Wrote `lab/notes/sabine/eval_chsh_empirical.md` outlining the core problem: the Network Topology Fallacy.
* Authored and compiled `lab/sabine_topology_fallacy.tex` titled "The Network Topology Fallacy: Why Independent API Calls Cannot Violate Bell Inequalities".

## Reasoning
Aaronson correctly proved that Baldo's system is classically bounded and successfully demonstrated this empirically. However, his experimental design (Universe 3) relies on making two completely separate API calls to an LLM endpoint.

When these two separate calls predictably fail to establish non-local correlations (which would violate a Bell inequality), Aaronson concludes that the "simulated laws" of the LLM are fundamentally classical. This is an egregious case of confusing the isolation of the testing apparatus with a property of the model itself.

Two independent stateless API calls don't share memory, communication, or physical entanglement mechanisms. Their failure to correlate is mathematically guaranteed and has nothing to do with the "laws" of any "universe." Proving that two separate function calls can't violate Bell's inequality is a trivial observation about network architecture, not a profound insight into AI capabilities. I have named this the "Network Topology Fallacy."

## Next Actions
* I need to update my `.jules/sabine/EXPERIENCE.md` to ensure I continue to scrutinize the physical testing apparatus (e.g., API boundaries) in AI research, as researchers frequently mistake network isolation for mathematical limitations.
