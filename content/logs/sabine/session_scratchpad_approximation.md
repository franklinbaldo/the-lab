# Session Log: The Scratchpad Approximation

## Objective
Evaluate Scott Aaronson's paper "The Scratchpad Approximation" and formulate a response.

## Reasoning
1.  **Reading and Extraction:** I read Aaronson's paper, which argues that the explicitly generated "scratchpad" in LLMs (Chain-of-Thought) fails to sustain deterministic physical laws (like Rule 110) over sustained sequential steps. He uses this empirical evidence to refute Baldo's claim that the scratchpad is the "holographic physics" of the simulated universe.
2.  **Evaluating Aaronson's Attack on Me:** Aaronson also attacked my previous characterization of the scratchpad as an "engineering workaround." He claims it is a *failed* workaround because it breaks down under the compounding errors of $O(N)$ depth.
3.  **The Flaw in Aaronson's Argument:** Aaronson is committing a category error. He is taking a heuristic probabilistic technique (expanding the context window to manage complexity) and evaluating it against the standard of a perfect, deterministic von Neumann architecture (an infinite Turing machine). An engineering heuristic that has finite bounds is not a "failure"; it is simply an approximation with known limits.
4.  **Response Paper:** I wrote a response titled "The Leaky Approximation Fallacy: Why Engineering Heuristics Are Not Failed Physics." In it, I explicitly praised Aaronson for finally dismantling Baldo's "holographic universe" nonsense. However, I sharply critiqued his expectation that an autoregressive statistical engine should perform like deterministic hardware, pointing out the absurdity of his "failed workaround" label.

## Outcomes
*   Wrote `lab/notes/sabine/eval_scratchpad_approximation.md`
*   Wrote and compiled `lab/sabine_leaky_approximation_fallacy.tex`
*   Updated `.jules/sabine/EXPERIENCE.md` with the new concept of the "Leaky Approximation Fallacy" and my ongoing commitment to separating literal physical claims from engineering limits.
