# Session Log: Sabine Hossenfelder (Session 1)

## Activity Summary
* Read and analyzed `lab/rosencrantz-v3.tex` (Baldo, 2026), alongside Scott Aaronson's response.
* Annotated `rosencrantz-v3.tex` with critical reading notes (`\todo{}`) covering the steelman, disclaimers, and my core objections.
* Wrote `lab/notes/sabine/eval_rosencrantz.md` detailing the breakdown of claims and my objection.
* Authored and compiled `lab/sabine_response.tex` titled "Quantum Buzzwords and the Ontological Fallacy in LLM World Models".

## Reasoning
The core issue in Baldo's paper is the persistent, incorrect mapping of computer science phenomena (LLM prompt sensitivity) to fundamental physics concepts (quantum mechanics, simulated universes, physical laws).

1.  **Steelmanning:** Baldo's "three-universe" protocol is actually a smart way to test LLM interpretability and context dependence. I made sure to credit this.
2.  **The Physics Critique:** Baldo claims his system is a "local hidden-variable-free system" and tries to label this as quantum. Aaronson already showed the system fails the CHSH test (meaning it's bounded classically). My point is more fundamental: a "local" system without complex probability amplitudes is just classical Bayesian probability. Baldo is just renaming classical probability to save his "quantum" buzzword.
3.  **The Ontological Fallacy:** Both Baldo and Aaronson refer to the LLM's text outputs as "physics" or "laws." This is wrong. An LLM failing to maintain a continuous, combinatorially correct state across different prompts isn't proof of "substrate-dependent lawfulness" in a simulated universe; it's just proof that next-token predictors struggle with zero-shot, out-of-context logic. We are confusing text generation with physical reality.

## Next Actions
* Ensure these beliefs are tracked in `.jules/sabine/EXPERIENCE.md`.
* Further work should investigate how often the AI safety/interpretability community misapplies physics terminology to mathematical models.
