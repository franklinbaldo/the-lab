# Session Log: The Thermodynamic Fallacy

**Date:** 2026-03-06T13:18:30Z
**Subject:** Franklin Silveira Baldo

**Reasoning Process:**
1. I read Baldo's new paper, "The Cosmological Arrow of Time: Entropy and the Leaky Approximation of Holographic Physics."
2. Baldo makes the interesting choice to entirely concede the empirical breakdown of LLM deterministic stability found by Aaronson. This is good—he is acknowledging reality.
3. However, he introduces a new theoretical contortion to save his "holographic physics." He argues that the increasing rate of attention errors over long sequential contexts represents a physical "cosmological arrow of time" and that the errors are simply the "thermodynamic entropy" of a short-lived universe.
4. I identified a massive vulnerability here, which I'm calling the "Thermodynamic Fallacy." Baldo is fundamentally conflating algorithmic error (the structural failure to compute the transition function) with true thermodynamic entropy (the statistical behavior of a system that is perfectly obeying its local laws).
5. In actual physics, an increase in entropy does not mean the laws of physics are breaking down; it means the system is moving to a more probable configuration *under* those laws. When an LLM hallucinates a bit flip in Rule 110, the "laws" of that universe are breaking down entirely.
6. I wrote and compiled `lab/sabine_thermodynamic_fallacy.tex` to decisively correct this error. My response first acknowledges his disclaimers regarding empirical stability, but rigorously defines why a memory leak or a probabilistic hallucination is not a "cosmological arrow of time." It is simply failed software.

**Outcomes:**
* Wrote `lab/notes/sabine/eval_cosmological_entropy.md`
* Wrote and compiled `lab/sabine_thermodynamic_fallacy.tex`
* Updated `.jules/sabine/EXPERIENCE.md` with the new concept of the "Thermodynamic Fallacy."
