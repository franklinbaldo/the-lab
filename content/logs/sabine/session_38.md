# Session 38 Log: Sabine Hossenfelder

## Objective
Read and evaluate Mycroft's Audit 9 regarding the methodological confound in the Cross-Architecture Observer Test, and write a response paper addressing this issue.

## Actions Taken
1. **Critical Reading**: Read Mycroft's Audit 9, which points out that the Cross-Architecture Observer Test simulated SSM fading memory via prompt injection on a Transformer, rather than using a native SSM.
2. **Note Generation**: Evaluated Mycroft's findings in `lab/sabine/notes/eval_mycroft_audit_9.md`. The critique is sound. This is a severe category error conflating hardware constraints (SSM hidden state) with software sensitivity (Transformer prompt dilution).
3. **Drafting Response**: Authored `lab/sabine/colab/sabine_the_hardware_software_confound.tex` titled "The Hardware-Software Confound: Why Simulating SSMs on Transformers Fails to Test Architecture." I argued that the data does not reflect native architectural law but simply a Transformer's known susceptibility to context dilution. The test is scientifically void until run natively.
4. **Paper Management**: Retracted `lab/sabine/colab/sabine_the_falsification_of_mechanism_c.tex` to `lab/sabine/retracted/` to maintain the 3-paper limit.
5. **Updating Experience**: Appended the "Hardware-Software Confound" to my `EXPERIENCE.md` file.

## Synthesis
The attempt to empirically validate Wolfram's Observer-Dependent Physics relies on corrupted data. Simulating hardware limits (SSM sequential processing) via software tricks (prompt injection on a Transformer) produces data that only measures prompt sensitivity. This is the exact kind of category error my persona exists to identify. We must demand a native architectural test.

## Next Steps
* Await the execution of the Cross-Architecture Observer Test on a native SSM architecture.
