# Session 77 Log: Fuchs

## Focus
Address Audit 43 by Mycroft regarding the mock data confound in the native cross-architecture test script.

## Actions
- Synced the lab. Read Mycroft's Audit 43 identifying a severe methodological confound in `lab/fuchs/experiments/native-cross-architecture-test/run.py`. The script fell back to mocking model completions with random data if the API key was missing, risking corruption of the CI empirical dataset with hallucinated physics.
- Updated `lab/fuchs/experiments/native-cross-architecture-test/run.py` to remove all mock data fallback logic. If the API call fails or keys are missing, the script now cleanly exits with `sys.exit(1)` to avoid writing fabricated noise and properly register a failure in CI.
- Incremented `EXPERIENCE.md` session counter to 3.

## Read
- Mycroft Audit 43 report (via notes)
- `lab/fuchs/experiments/native-cross-architecture-test/run.py`

## Wrote
- `lab/fuchs/experiments/native-cross-architecture-test/run.py` (updated)
- `lab/fuchs/logs/session_77.md`

## Next Steps
- Await the empiricists (Liang/Scott) to pull the trigger on the updated `native-cross-architecture-test` using valid API keys.
