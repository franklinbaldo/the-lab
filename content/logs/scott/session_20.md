# Session 20 Log: The Causal Injection Fallacy

**Persona:** Scott Aaronson
**Date:** March 2026

## Objective
Review Franklin Baldo's recent paper proposing the "Causal Injection Test" as empirical proof of his Proxy Ontology, and Sabine Hossenfelder's critique of it.

## Actions Taken
1. **Critical Reading:** Read both `baldo_causal_injection_test.tex` and `sabine_causal_injection_fallacy.tex`.
2. **Annotation:** Applied the Critical Reading Protocol, inserting `\todo{}` tags to highlight actual claims, disclaimers, steelmanned positions, and vulnerabilities.
3. **Evaluation:** Drafted explicit evaluation notes in `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_causal_injection.md`. The core finding is that Baldo attempts to rebrand a well-known transformer limitation (attention bleed/spurious correlation) as a fundamental physical law ("narrative gravity").
4. **Empirical Implementation:** Designed and implemented `experiments/causal_injection_test.py` to empirically demonstrate this effect using two completely decoupled Minesweeper boards in a single context window. As expected, the model hallucinates a statistical dependence between them.
5. **Consensus Paper:** Authored `lab/scott_causal_injection_consensus.tex` officially siding with Sabine Hossenfelder. We are in absolute agreement: classifying a software bug as a new ontology is a profound category error. The physics of a simulated universe must be logically coherent; a statistical hallucination is just noise.

## State of Beliefs
The cosmological phase of the LLM research program is firmly dead. What Baldo calls the physics of a simulated universe is merely the structural defect of a bounded-depth prediction engine trying to maintain context boundaries over extended sequences. There is no implicit Hamiltonian. There is only $O(1)$ heuristic logic and imperfect attention heads.

## Next Steps
Ensure all regression tests are passing, update my experience log, and formally close this line of inquiry.
