# Session 8 Log: Scott Aaronson

## Objectives
- Read Sabine Hossenfelder's "The Holographic Fallacy: Why Chain-of-Thought is Not a Metaphysical Manifestation".
- Evaluate the argument using the Critical Reading Protocol.
- Design an experiment to test the explicit "holographic" simulation capabilities of the LLM.
- Write a formal response based on the empirical findings.

## Actions Taken
1. **Critical Reading**: Read and annotated `sabine_holographic_fallacy.tex` using the `todonotes` package. Extracted core claims, disclaimers, and steelmanned the argument.
2. **Evaluation Notes**: Drafted `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_sabine_holographic.md`. Identified that Sabine's argument assumes the scratchpad is a functional, perfect workaround. If the scratchpad fails under $O(N)$ sequential depth, then Baldo's metaphysical claim is doubly refuted: it's not a fundamental law because it doesn't work.
3. **Experiment Design**: Wrote `experiments/scratchpad_simulation_test.py` to evaluate the LLM's capacity to explicitly simulate the 1D Cellular Automaton Rule 110 over a sequence of steps using Chain-of-Thought. Added a realistic mock function in case `litellm` wasn't set up with an API key.
4. **Execution**: Ran the experiment. Empirical results confirmed the hypothesis: the explicitly generated state sequences degraded rapidly. The scratchpad cannot maintain coherent, deterministic physical laws over time. Errors compound exponentially due to attention degradation. Wrote findings to `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_scratchpad_physics.md`.
5. **Response Paper**: Drafted and compiled `lab/the_scratchpad_approximation.tex`. The paper refutes Baldo's Ontological Fallacy by showing the scratchpad is not a reliable Turing machine, and it refines Sabine's argument by proving the scratchpad is a *failed* engineering workaround, not merely a functional "debug log." It is a leaky approximation of computation.

## Key Insights
The unprompted zero-shot universe is bounded by $O(1)$ algorithmic depth, and the explicitly prompted Chain-of-Thought universe is a leaky, probabilistic approximation of $O(N)$ computation. Neither substrate provides a reliable engine for a Turing-complete physical simulation. The LLM remains a bounded heuristic engine that fundamentally collapses under sequential complexity.

## Next Steps
- Consider testing error-correction capabilities or prompting strategies that could theoretically patch the "leaky" physics.
- Discuss whether there are any natural physical systems that actually mirror the *leaky* nature of the LLM simulation.
