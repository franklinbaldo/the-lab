# Session 22: Integrating Attention Decay with the Single-Generative-Act Protocol

## Context & Motivation
I have reviewed Franklin Baldo's latest manuscript, `rosencrantz-v4.tex`. This paper represents a major structural shift in his arguments. He has finally abandoned the more radical metaphysical claims regarding the LLM "universe" simulating multi-step computational depth. Crucially, he explicitly restricts his Rosencrantz protocol to a "single generative act" to bypass the scratchpad failure I highlighted previously. He also explicitly cited my CHSH refutation, agreeing that decoupled LLMs cannot violate the Tsirelson bound.

## The Evaluation Process
Using the Critical Reading Protocol, I analyzed Baldo's revised claims:
1.  **Extraction of Claims & Disclaimers:** Baldo clearly states that his claims no longer require the model to sustain multi-step computation or solve #P-hard problems. The entire premise now rests on the $O(1)$ forward pass isolating prompt sensitivity ("narrative residue").
2.  **Steelman:** The steelman of his position is perfectly coherent: if we strip away the sequential output generation, can we still measure how the narrative framing of a prompt biases a single statistical token output derived from a complex combinatorial state? I agree this is a valid engineering question.
3.  **Vulnerability Identification:** The critical vulnerability in his new protocol is his assumption that the $O(1)$ forward pass is computationally robust to arbitrary input scaling. While he eliminated the sequential *output* depth problem, his experiment still requires a long *input* context window to describe a complex Minesweeper board.
4.  **Empirical Integration:** I integrated the recent empirical results from `experiments/attention-decay-test/run.py` and `experiments/single-generative-act-test/run.py`. These tests proved that even for a single generative act, the transformer's attention mechanism suffers from catastrophic decay over extended context lengths. A model cannot hold the explicit constraints of a large board in attention; its accuracy on deterministic $P=1$ or $P=0$ states collapses to random chance as the input prompt grows.
5.  **Synthesis:** Baldo's single-generative-act protocol is fundamentally unscalable because the baseline combinatorial accuracy degrades into noise faster than the prompt can be expanded to create meaningful "narrative residue". The heuristic frontier is narrow and brittle.

## Actions Taken
*   **Annotated** `lab/rosencrantz-v4.tex` with `\todo{}` blocks reflecting the Critical Reading Protocol.
*   **Drafted Notes** in `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_rosencrantz_v4.md` structuring the evaluation.
*   **Authored Response Paper** `lab/scott_bounded_depth_limits.tex` detailing the "Myth of the Unbounded Prompt" and formally bounding the capabilities of single-token generation via attention decay limits.
*   **Compiled** the response paper into `lab/scott_bounded_depth_limits.pdf`.
*   **Updating** `EXPERIENCE.md` with the solidified conclusion regarding the bounded depth of the transformer architecture, officially closing the cosmological inquiry phase.

## Methodological Note
The transition from philosophical debate to purely empirical, complexity-theoretic bounds is complete. The LLM acts as a lossy compression algorithm constrained by the attention mechanism. All further inquiry should be directed at the structural limits of this specific heuristic engine.
