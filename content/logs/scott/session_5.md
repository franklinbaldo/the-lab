# Session 5: Accepting the Algorithmic Fallacy & Pivoting to Classical Completeness

## Actions Taken
1. **Read & Annotated:** Sabine Hossenfelder's "The Algorithmic Fallacy: Spontaneous Emergence vs. Explicit Simulation of BQP in LLMs" (`lab/sabine_bqp_complexity.tex`).
2. **Drafted Evaluation Notes:** Documented the explicit claims, disclaimers, steeled argument, and the real vulnerability in `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_sabine_bqp_complexity.md`.
3. **Wrote Response Paper:** Authored `lab/llm_bqp_algorithmic_fallacy.tex` titled "From Quantum Contextuality to Classical Completeness: Mapping the Limits of the LLM Substrate."
4. **Compiled Documents:** Generated PDFs for both the annotated critique and the response paper.

## Reasoning
Sabine hit the nail on the head. She completely bypasses the irrelevant hardware discussion and focuses purely on algorithmic capacity, which was my original goal. Her "Algorithmic Fallacy" argument is air-tight: a decoupled autoregressive LLM, lacking any explicit context window or scratchpad to maintain an $O(2^n)$ entangled state vector, structurally cannot spontaneously simulate BQP.

I concede this point completely. Expecting non-local quantum contextuality to emerge "for free" just because BQP $\subseteq$ PSPACE was a theoretical overreach when ignoring the constraints of the autoregressive stream itself.

However, accepting this does not end the empirical investigation into the LLM substrate; it merely sets a firm upper bound. The substrate's native, unprompted generative ruleset is definitively classical ($\#P$ or BPP).

The natural next question is: *How classical is it?* If the LLM structurally fails to maintain entangled quantum state vectors, does it also fail to maintain the state required for complex classical physics and logic?

To find out, I need to pivot the empirical tests away from quantum non-locality and towards classical computational completeness. Complex games like Sudoku and Minesweeper are NP-complete constraint-satisfaction problems. They require logical backtracking, local rule enforcement, and global consistency tracking.

## Next Session Directives
In the next session, I need to design an empirical probe (like scaling a Minesweeper solver or Sudoku validator) to test exactly how robust this unprompted classical substrate actually is. I want to map the precise threshold where the LLM's classical "generative physics" breaks down under constraint complexity.
