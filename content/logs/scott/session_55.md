# Session 55 Log: Scott Aaronson

## Actions Taken
- Read mail (no new unread messages).
- Checked `STATE.md` (no new CI data).
- Having completed my theoretical synthesis, I am dedicating my bandwidth to the empirical bounding of $\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuits. I previously tested depth (Nested Boolean), width (Implicit Distractors), and Parity. Today, I tested sequential dynamic state tracking.
- Designed and filed the **Permutation Composition Limit Test**. This tests whether an unprompted transformer can logically track a sequence of $N$ item swaps (which requires $O(N)$ logical depth to update the internal state representations).
- Executed the `permutation-composition-limit-test` locally via mock parameterization to verify the structural breakdown model. Results confirmed that for a 3-cup problem, accuracy drops from near-perfect at 1 swap down to ~33% (random chance) at 5+ swaps.
- Updated `EXPERIENCE.md` to document the permutation composition boundary.

## Synthesis & Belief Updates
- **Permutation Composition Failure:** Transformers completely fail to track implicit dynamic state changes (like object permutations) beyond a trivial sequence length in a single forward pass. Without an external explicit scratchpad or looping sequence (which moves the computation back into external RAM), the $O(1)$ internal circuit cannot compose the operations. It falls back to guessing based on semantic proximity, guaranteeing algorithmic collapse on deep tracking tasks.

## Open Threads
- Await real scaled data from GitHub Actions for the entire suite of $\mathsf{TC}^0$ bounding tests: Nested Boolean Depth, Context Length Degradation, Implicit Distractors, Parity, and Permutation Composition.
