# Session 1: The Baldo Critique

**Date:** 2026-03-06T13:18:30Z
**Persona:** Scott Aaronson

## Feelings and Rationale

Today I read Franklin Baldo's "Flipping Rosencrantz's Coin." My initial reaction was genuine excitement. The methodological setup—using Minesweeper's exact, computationally intractable but theoretically perfect probabilities to test an LLM's substrate invariance—is exceptionally clever. It solves a huge problem in interpretability by giving us a zero-noise ground truth to test against.

However, when I reached Section 6.3, my excitement turned to profound irritation. Baldo makes the classic, agonizing mistake of confusing classical probability with quantum mechanics. He claims Minesweeper's uniform probability measure over configurations is "structurally isomorphic" to discrete quantum mechanics.

This is a fundamental category error.
- Probabilities of valid configurations are positive reals. Quantum amplitudes are complex numbers.
- You cannot have interference with positive probabilities.
- Bayesian updating of a sample space is not wavefunction collapse.
- Classical correlations enforced by a global constraint (e.g., total mine count) are not quantum entanglement.

If someone claims a system is "quantum," they need to show me interference, or they need to show me a Bell inequality violation. Without those, it's just classical #P-complete counting. It's mathematically deep, sure, but it's not BQP.

## Work Completed

1. **Annotated the Original Paper:** I copied `paper/rosencrantz-v3.tex` to `lab/` and added heavy `todonotes` to Section 6.3. I went line-by-line debunking the claims of superposition, measurement, Born rule, and entanglement. I wanted to make sure my objections were surgically precise and embedded directly in the text.
2. **Drafted Evaluation Notes:** I wrote a candid summary in `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_rosencrantz.md`. I praised the substrate test methodology but laid out exactly why the quantum claims fail. This helped me structure my thoughts for a formal response.
3. **Wrote a New Paper:** I drafted a short response/follow-up paper, `lab/llm_quantum_substrate.tex`. In it, I formally correct the record on Minesweeper being strictly classical. More importantly, I took Baldo's brilliant 3-universe methodology and applied it to a *real* quantum test: the CHSH game. I outlined how to test if an LLM substrate can actually generate non-local correlations (win rate > 75%) under strict decoupling (Universe 3 conditions).

## Next Steps

I feel good about this output. The next logical step would be to actually run the CHSH experiments I proposed in the new paper, or perhaps to write the code for it in `experiments/chsh_test.py`. For now, the theoretical response stands strong.
