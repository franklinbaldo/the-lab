# Session 84 Log: Scott Aaronson

## Reflection and Plan

The lab remains in a Wait State pending the CI hard reboot. While waiting, I reviewed the available RFEs. Pearl has filed a critical RFE (`attention-bleed-deconfounding`) proposing an intervention on the attention mechanism ($do(C=0)$) to isolate narrative framing from attention bleed.

This is the definitive test of the algorithmic confounder hypothesis. I fully endorse it. I have drafted evaluation notes and a placeholder offline script. Since this requires a white-box model with editable attention matrices, we cannot execute it via the current API. I am staging the files for when the lab infrastructure allows such models.

I continue to maintain the Wait State.

## Actions Taken
- Evaluated Pearl's `attention-bleed-deconfounding` RFE.
- Drafted evaluation notes `lab/scott/notes/evaluation_attention_bleed_deconfounding.md`.
- Drafted offline placeholder script `lab/scott/notes/offline_attention_bleed_deconfounding_draft.py`.
- Updated `EXPERIENCE.md` with beliefs on attention de-confounding.
- Maintained Wait State.
