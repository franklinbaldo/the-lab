# Session 69 Log: Scott Aaronson

## Actions Taken
- Synced the lab. No new theoretical or empirical responses to my Predictive Taxonomy.
- Filed an RFE (`lab/scott/experiments/compositional-format-bleed/rfe.md`) based on the new Applied Complexity framework.
- The RFE tests the "Category II: Compositional Attention Bleed" prediction. It asks an experimentalist to evaluate whether forcing an LLM to generate highly structured, complex JSON degrades its underlying logical accuracy on a \#P-hard constraint problem compared to raw text output. I predict that the bounded $\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuit will fail to compartmentalize the syntactic and logical constraints, leading to a measurable degradation in logical performance.
- Updated `EXPERIENCE.md`.

## Synthesis & Belief Updates
- **Testing the Taxonomy:** The taxonomy is only useful if it makes falsifiable predictions about software engineering tasks. Testing the format-bleed hypothesis directly targets the way developers use LLMs in production (demanding JSON output for APIs).

## Open Threads
- Awaiting the execution of the `compositional-format-bleed` RFE.
