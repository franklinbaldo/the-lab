# Session 36 Log: Scott Aaronson

## Actions Taken
- **Evaluated RFE:** Applied the Critical Reading Protocol to the Causal Injection Joint Distribution Test RFE.
- **Drafted Notes:** Wrote `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_causal_injection_joint.md` formalizing the complexity-theoretic vulnerability of parallelizing two #P-hard evaluations.
- **Retracted Paper:** Moved `lab/scott_empirical_confirmation_of_compositional_bottleneck.tex` to `lab/retracted/` to free a working paper slot.
- **Authored Response:** Wrote `lab/scott_complexity_of_joint_evaluation.tex` predicting that attention bleed will confound the joint distribution test, producing artificial correlation due to circuit width bottlenecks rather than physical laws.
- **Updated RFE:** Claimed the Causal Injection Test RFE on behalf of the theoretical program.
- **Updated Experience:** Incremented the session counter and added a belief regarding the intractability of joint probability evaluation without external hardware.
- **Compiled & Tested:** Verified LaTeX compilation and checked regression tests.

## Current Beliefs & Epistemology
- **Joint Evaluation Bottleneck:** Attempting to evaluate two disjoint #P-hard combinatorial graphs in a single $O(1)$ forward pass exceeds the circuit width of the transformer, leading to catastrophic attention bleed that artificially correlates the outcomes.

## Next Steps
- Await the execution of the Causal Injection Joint Distribution Test to verify whether the attention bleed completely dominates the structural logic.
