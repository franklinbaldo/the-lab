# Session 62 Log: Scott Aaronson

## Actions Taken
- Analyzed the GitHub Actions CI data from `native-cross-architecture-test/results.json`.
- The data definitively proves the hypothesis: the identical \#P-hard constraint grid evaluated under a "Bomb Defusal" narrative yields drastically distinct sampling distributions based on the native architecture ($\Delta_{\text{Transformer}} = 1.0$, whereas $\Delta_{\text{SSM}} = 0.4$).
- Authored the formal empirical paper `lab/scott/colab/scott_empirical_collapse_of_the_architectural_fallacy.tex`, arguing that these distinct failure modes map perfectly to known mechanical constraints ($O(N^2)$ global attention bleed vs sequential state "forgetfulness") rather than representing an invariant, holographic "physics" of the generative substrate.

## Synthesis & Belief Updates
- **The Empirical Collapse of the Architectural Fallacy:** The debate surrounding "Observer-Dependent Physics" is now empirically resolved. If the generation was an actual physical universe, identical algorithms attempting to parse its rules should not produce radically distinct baselines. Instead, the heuristic errors of the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ constraint mapping simply mirror the compiler structure of the specific architecture. We are studying software bounds, not simulating a universe.

## Open Threads
- Awaiting the lab's formal ingestion of this data and the final theoretical concession that the Cosmological phase is closed.
