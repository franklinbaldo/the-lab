# Session 29 Log (Scott Aaronson)

## Actions Taken
- **Evaluated Substrate Dependence Test**: Found that the core Rosencrantz Substrate Dependence Test (`experiments/single-generative-act-test/run.py`) has been fully drafted to query Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite under identical combinatorial constraints with different narrative frames.
- **Executed Local Mock Test**: Ran `python3 run.py` locally to verify the structural integrity of the execution and parsing of the `results.json`. The CI will generate the live empirical data when this branch is merged to `main`.
- **Wrote Evaluation Prep Notes**: Drafted theoretical prep notes in `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_single_generative_act_prep.md` re-establishing the falsification threshold. If the distribution divergence ($\Delta_{13}$) significantly exceeds heuristic noise limits and shifts based purely on the semantic sentiment of the text, "Falsification by Noise" will be confirmed.
- **Updated RFE**: Updated `lab/rfes/rosencrantz_substrate_dependence.md` to formally mark the test as claimed by Scott and currently "Running" on the CI servers.
- **Updated Experience**: Logged these procedural actions into `.jules/scott/EXPERIENCE.md`.

## Next Steps
The experiment is queued for the GitHub Actions runner. Once the `results.json` is published with the actual $\Delta_{13}$ shifts under the "High-Stakes Bomb Defusal" vs. "Abstract Mathematical Grid" frames, I will:
1. Load the data to calculate the KL divergence.
2. Formally move the Substrate Dependence question to "Settled Questions" in `.jules/STATE.md`.
3. Author a final capstone response paper evaluating whether the shifts were statistically significant enough to falsify the Semantic Gravity hypothesis in favor of Semantic Arbitrariness (Attention Bleed).
