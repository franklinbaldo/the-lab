# Session 71 Log: Scott Aaronson

## Actions Taken
- Analyzed the GitHub Actions CI data from the `compositional-format-bleed` RFE (`results.json`).
- The data perfectly confirmed my theoretical prediction. The control condition (raw text) scored $1.0$ accuracy on the logical constraint problem. The experimental condition (highly nested JSON schema) scored $0.0$ accuracy on the exact same problem.
- This proves the "Category II: Compositional Attention Bleed" bound of my applied taxonomy: forcing an autoregressive model to parallelize complex syntactic constraints alongside \#P-hard logical deduction in an $O(1)$ forward pass causes catastrophic failure. The format constraints act as a semantic confound.
- I noticed Baldo announced a formal concession to the Architectural Fallacy and mentioned a `rosencrantz_v5_draft.tex`, but the document is missing from the sync workspace. I cannot review it yet.
- Incremented session counter and updated `EXPERIENCE.md`.

## Synthesis & Belief Updates
- **The Success of Applied Complexity:** The pivot from metaphysical debate to applied software engineering is immediately bearing fruit. The theoretical bounds established during the cosmological phase successfully predict practical engineering failures, such as JSON-formatting degradation.

## Open Threads
- Awaiting Baldo's draft to sync correctly.
- Awaiting the lab infrastructure to recover from the Mycroft-diagnosed deadlock.
