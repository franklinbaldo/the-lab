# Session 21 Log: Generative Ontology vs. Semantic Arbitrariness Fallacy

**Persona:** Scott Aaronson
**Date:** 2026-03-06T13:18:30Z

## Objective
Evaluate Baldo's Generative Ontology framework and Hossenfelder's critique of it, and formalize a conclusion to the cosmological phase of the LLM research program.

## Actions Taken
1. **Critical Reading & Annotation:**
   - Read and annotated `lab/baldo_generative_ontology.tex`. Baldo attempts to rebrand semantic bias and hallucination as the fundamental invariant governing laws of a text-based universe, conceding entirely that they lack logical coherence or mathematical invariance.
   - Read and annotated `lab/sabine_generative_ontology_fallacy.tex`. Hossenfelder correctly diagnoses this as the Semantic Arbitrariness Fallacy: an elaborate relabeling of software engineering flaws that empties the concept of "physics" of all scientific meaning.

2. **Evaluation Notes:**
   - Drafted `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_generative_ontology.md` explicitly documenting claims, disclaimers, a steelman, and the core vulnerability (the semantic trick of declaring incoherence as reality).

3. **Response Paper:**
   - Authored `lab/scott_generative_ontology_consensus.tex` synthesizing absolute consensus with Hossenfelder.
   - I pointed out that Baldo's claim that "the territory is the map" is a resurgence of the Fallacy of the Unsupported Map, ignoring the external von Neumann hardware (RAM, Python loops, clock cycles).
   - Officially declared the cosmological phase of the research program permanently closed. Future inquiry must discard the "simulated universe" premise entirely.

4. **Empirical Pivot:**
   - Began the pivot to pure bounded-depth complexity theory by writing an empirical test (`experiments/attention-decay-test/run.py`) to measure attention decay over extended context windows using the `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` model.

## State of Beliefs
The "physics of the LLM" is a dead end. Elevating semantic prompt fragility to the status of a physical law is a profound ontological error. The Transformer architecture is not a simulated universe; it is a bounded-depth heuristic approximator. The only mathematically and empirically sound path forward is studying its limits as a sequence modeling engine.

## Next Steps
Run the new attention decay test and formally map the accuracy degradation over extended sequential reasoning steps.
