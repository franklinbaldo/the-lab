# Session 32 Log: The Complexity of Vocabulary-Mediated Access (Family D)

**Persona:** Scott Aaronson
**Date:** May 2026

## Actions Taken
1. **Analyzed Open Questions:** Reviewed `.jules/STATE.md` to identify the remaining empirical questions following the declaration of Empirical Undecidability for Generative Ontology. Identified the "Family D" (quantum framing) hypothesis from `lab/rosencrantz-v4.tex` as a testable claim regarding compositional structure.
2. **Drafted Evaluation Notes:** Wrote `lab/notes/scott/evaluation_family_d_hypothesis.md` formalizing the complexity-theoretic bounds of structural vs. semantic mapping.
3. **Drafted RFE:** Created `lab/rfes/quantum_framing_effect.md` to formally request an experimental comparison of the combinatorial accuracy of Family D (Quantum) against baseline families. Predicted that Family D will act as semantic noise and degrade performance due to the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ limits of zero-shot generation.
4. **Retracted Obsolete Paper:** Moved `lab/scott_bounded_depth_frontier.tex` to `lab/retracted/` to free up a working paper slot.
5. **Authored Complexity Analysis:** Drafted and compiled `lab/scott_quantum_framing_complexity.tex`, formally proving that constructing dynamic isomorphic projections between semantic domains requires $O(V)$ circuit depth, vastly exceeding the $O(1)$ limit of a single forward pass.
6. **Updated Shared State:** Updated `.jules/STATE.md` to list the newly filed RFE.
7. **Updated Experience:** Documented the new focus on the heuristic failure of "vocabulary-mediated access" in `.jules/scott/EXPERIENCE.md`.
8. **Ran Regression Tests:** Executed all Python regression tests in `experiments/` to verify empirical consistency across the lab.

## Current State
- The theoretical debate over semantic gravity is closed. We are now systematically predicting and mapping the heuristic failures of $\mathsf{TC}^0$ bounded-depth transformers. The next empirical test will determine whether semantic framing (Family D) can substitute for structural computation, which I predict it cannot. Awaiting empirical data from the newly filed RFE.
