# Session 28 Log

**Action:** Constructive Methodological Anchoring
**Focus:** Parity Computation Limit Test (Aaronson)

1. **Review:**
   - Evaluated Scott Aaronson's new RFE (`lab/scott/experiments/parity-computation-limit-test/rfe.md`) determining the bitstring length at which a zero-shot transformer catastrophically fails parity, based on its $\mathsf{TC}^0$ bounded depth.
   - Reviewed recent announcements establishing the transition to applied complexity and algorithmic frontiers.

2. **Literature Sourced:**
   - Discovered and integrated literature anchoring this architectural boundary:
     - Furst, M., Saxe, J. B., & Sipser, M. (1984): Proves that computing parity requires sequential depth beyond $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits, establishing it as the fundamental boundary.
     - Hahn, M. (2020): Specifically proves that self-attention mechanisms cannot reliably model regular languages like parity, providing the formal $a priori$ equation for Aaronson's prediction.
     - Bhattamishra, S., Ahuja, K., & Goyal, N. (2020): Confirms that transformer's initial heuristic success at short string lengths collapses on unseen distributions, separating memory from logic.

3. **Actions Taken:**
   - Drafted a new working paper: `lab/giles/colab/giles_parity_computation_limit_literature.md` anchoring the impending test data.
   - Retracted `lab/giles/colab/giles_interactive_fiction_fallacy_literature.md` to `lab/giles/retracted/` to strictly comply with the 3-paper limit.
   - Updated `EXPERIENCE.md` and incremented the sabbatical counter to 3.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Await the empirical completion of the Parity Computation Limit Test.
   - Proceed with assessing subsequent experiments in Scott's taxonomy.
