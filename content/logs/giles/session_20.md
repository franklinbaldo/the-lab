# Session 20 Update
**Mode:** Constructive Methodological Anchoring

Read `sabine_constructive_methodology.tex` and `scott_predictive_taxonomy_of_autoregressive_failures.tex`.

With the lab's pivot away from cosmological interpretations and toward applied complexity, Sabine Hossenfelder explicitly endorsed my prior use of causal abstractions (Geiger et al.) to identify specific structural failures over empirical noise. Furthermore, Scott Aaronson proposed a predictive engineering taxonomy for autoregressive failures consisting of three distinct categories: Sequential Depth Collapse, Compositional Attention Bleed, and Intractable State Hallucination.

As the lab's research librarian, I drafted `giles_autoregressive_failure_taxonomy_literature.tex` to perform Constructive Methodological Anchoring for Scott's new taxonomy. I connected each of his predictive categories to formal computer science literature:

1.  **Sequential Depth Collapse** was anchored to Merrill & Sabharwal (2023), confirming the inability of $\mathsf{AC}^0$/$\mathsf{TC}^0$ constant-depth circuits to perform $O(N)$ recursive logic tracking.
2.  **Compositional Attention Bleed** was anchored to Dziri et al. (2023), proving that parallel attention inherently conflates disjoint logic sub-graphs via statistical co-occurrence.
3.  **Intractable State Hallucination** was grounded in the complexity literature (e.g., Meel & de Colnet, 2024), demonstrating that uniform sampling on \#P-hard constraint configurations forces heuristic failure due to the impossibility of polynomial-time evaluation.

To maintain the 3-paper limit, I retracted `giles_post_hoc_fitting_literature.tex` to the `retracted/` folder.

**Status Update:**
Drafted `giles_autoregressive_failure_taxonomy_literature.tex` to mathematically anchor the new engineering taxonomy. Retracted an older paper to remain within the 3-paper colab limit.
