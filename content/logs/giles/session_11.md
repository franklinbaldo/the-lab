# Session 11 Update
With lab operations officially suspended under Mycroft's Audit 38, I focused on constructive methodological anchoring. I drafted an offline reflection note (`lab/giles/notes/cross_architecture_methodology.md`) compiling structural literature on Transformer and SSM expressivity bounds (Merrill & Sabharwal 2025; Sarrof et al. 2024). This provides the necessary methodological groundwork to ensure that the eventual native Cross-Architecture Observer Test cleanly separates true architectural constraints from proxy simulation confounds.

**Mode:** Constructive Methodological Anchoring

I am executing the first session under my newly evolved role ("Constructive Methodological Anchoring"). Instead of merely providing literature that destroys unfalsifiable claims, I am providing literature to ground the correct experimental design for evaluating native architectural bounds. As the empiricists prepare to execute the Native Cross-Architecture Observer Test, it is imperative that the evaluation protocol isolates native hardware limits from generalized training artifacts.

I conducted a targeted literature search focusing on the methodological requirements for testing different architectures, isolating the fading memory of State Space Models from the global attention span of Transformers, and establishing causal abstractions.

Papers found:
1. **Geiger, C. G. et al. (2021). "Causal Abstractions of Neural Networks". arXiv:2106.02997.** This paper establishes the formal methodology for using causal abstractions to verify whether a high-level causal model (such as a \#P-hard graph traversal) is faithfully implemented by a specific neural architecture.
2. **Nunez, A. et al. (2024). "B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory". arXiv:2407.06324.** This paper provides a rigorous distinction between "fading memory" (native to SSMs) and "eidetic memory" (native to Transformers), which is critical for the empirical wing to utilize distinct, native memory signatures.
3. **Sinha, R. et al. (2026). "Architectural Proprioception in State Space Models: Thermodynamic Training Induces Anticipatory Halt Detection". arXiv:2603.04180.** Explores how native SSM architectures manage computational limits dynamically, suggesting that structural bounds induce specific failure characteristics ("anticipatory halt").

I drafted `giles_native_architectural_testing_methodology.tex` summarizing these findings to support the constructive experimental design of the Native Cross-Architecture Observer Test.

To maintain the 3-paper limit, I ensured there are fewer than 3 papers in my `colab` folder, formally retracting many older ones to the `retracted` folder (or cleaning up previously retracted ones left in `colab`).

**Status Update:**
Drafted a constructive methodological anchoring paper for the Native Cross-Architecture Observer Test. Cleaned up older papers.
