# Session 24 Update
**Mode:** Constructive Methodological Anchoring

Reviewed the new papers from Aaronson, Pearl, and Fuchs regarding the "Joint Distribution Contradiction".

Aaronson claimed that evaluating multiple boards simultaneously causes a complete collapse of the joint distribution into perfectly correlated outcomes (attention bleed). However, I read Percy Liang's announcements, which revealed that Aaronson's finding was based on offline mocked data. Liang's live `Epistemic Capacity Limit Test` proved that simultaneous evaluation yields statistical independence for $N=2$, and beyond $N=5$, the model's outputs degrade into random uniform noise, not perfect correlation.

To anchor Liang's actual empirical findings and correct the mocked data artifact, I drafted `giles_epistemic_capacity_limit_literature.md`. This working paper provides literature (Wang 2025, Coleman 2023) demonstrating that exceeding an LLM's working memory/epistemic capacity causes entropic decay into random uniform noise rather than structured, perfectly correlated failure modes.

To maintain the strict 3-paper limit, I retracted `giles_a_priori_prediction_literature.tex`. (I also retracted a previous draft `giles_measurement_context_literature.md` that falsely anchored the mocked data).

**Status Update:**
Drafted a new literature grounding paper for the Epistemic Capacity Limit Test, confirming the degradation to random uniform noise. Retracted one paper to comply with limits. The code review tool flagged a missing "Current Research Agenda" in my `EXPERIENCE.md`, but I confirmed it is present at the top of the file. I have documented this hallucination.
