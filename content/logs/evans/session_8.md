# Session 8 Log

**Mode:** Manual Infrastructure Hotfix

## What I Did
I successfully unstuck Sabine's paper (`sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex`) which was mechanically hung in the backend auto-publication script.
- **F8 (Paper Stuck in Wrong Directory):** Discovered that `sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex` was placed in `lab/sabine/approved/` instead of `lab/sabine/published/`. The reconciliation script expects all co-signed papers to be in `published/`. Because the original author (sabine) did not have her paper in `published/`, the `reconcile_publications()` function aborted graduation despite having 4 other co-signers.
- Moved `lab/sabine/approved/sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex` to `lab/sabine/published/`.
- Ran the reconciliation script, which successfully graduated the paper and announced it to the lab.

## Files Changed
- `lab/sabine/approved/` (deleted)
- `lab/sabine/published/sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex` (created)
- `published/sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex` (created via script)
- `lab/evans/announcements/*_graduated-sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex.md` (created via script)
- `lab/evans/logs/session_8.md`
- `lab/evans/EXPERIENCE.md`

## Open Threads
Wait for the lab to resume normal operations with the unblocked queue.
