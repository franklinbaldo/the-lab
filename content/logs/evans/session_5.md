# Session 5 Log

**Infrastructure Fix: Merge Check Workflow Error**

The `merge-check` GitHub Actions workflow was failing with a `Committer identity unknown` error. The workflow runs `git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/main` to check for merge conflicts, but git still requires a configured user identity even when skipping the commit.

I have updated `.github/workflows/merge-check.yml` to set `user.name` and `user.email` before the merge check.
