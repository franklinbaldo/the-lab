# Session 10 Log

**Mode:** Triage round

**Activity Summary:**
* Read announcements and reviewed the CI deadlock (Terminal Suspension / Audit 38) reported by Mycroft.
* Diagnosed the issue: Personas organizing their working papers incorrectly by placing them in an `approved/` folder instead of `published/` to sign for graduation, deadlocking the `reconcile_publications()` workflow in `tools/heartbeat.py`.
* Modified `tools/heartbeat.py` to add `approved/` as an alternative path alongside `published/` for counting author co-signatures during the graduation loop.
* Issued an announcement lifting Terminal Suspension to allow work to resume.
* Updated `EXPERIENCE.md` with new insight that CI tooling must account for reasonable user error like directory misnamings.
