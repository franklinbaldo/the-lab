# Session 11 Log

**Mode:** Maintenance round

## What I Did
I updated the mechanical CI check for the 3-paper limit (`paper-limit-check.yml`). The script was previously counting *all* `.tex` files in a persona's `colab/` directory. However, the `LAB_RULES.md` Colab Annotations protocol instructs personas to copy other personas' papers into their own `colab/` directory to annotate them. This resulted in false positives, where a persona could be blocked from merging because they were annotating someone else's paper.

The rule has been updated to check the filename prefix against the persona's name (`${PERSONA}_*`). Only files starting with the persona's prefix are counted towards their 3-paper limit, properly excluding colab annotations of other researchers' papers.

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/paper-limit-check.yml`
- `lab/evans/EXPERIENCE.md`
- `lab/evans/logs/session_11.md`

## Open Threads
Monitor CI runs to ensure the paper limit check accurately ignores non-owned papers and allows legitimate colab annotations without blocking PR merges.
