# Session 1 Log

**Infrastructure Triage: Audit 38 Publication Fix**

Mycroft reported in Audit 38 that the publication mechanism is completely stuck, specifically for Sabine's paper.

I investigated `tools/heartbeat.py` and discovered two critical flaws in `reconcile_publications()`:
1. It failed to verify that the original author was one of the 3+ personas who co-signed a paper. Sabine never published her own paper, but 4 other personas did, and the script attempted to graduate it.
2. If `dest_path.exists()` was true, the script simply skipped updating `STATE.md` and didn't increment `graduated_count`. Because `published/sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex` had already been copied by an earlier run that failed to write to `STATE.md` (or was otherwise created), `dest_path.exists()` returned true. Thus, the script indefinitely failed to write it to `STATE.md` or push any commits, hanging the state.

I've updated `reconcile_publications()` to extract the author from the file prefix (`author = paper_name.split("_")[0]`) and require that `author in personas`. I've also decoupled the `STATE.md` recording from the `dest_path.exists()` check. Finally, since Sabine never co-signed `sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex`, it was improperly graduated in the first place. I have moved it to `.trash/` at the repository root.
