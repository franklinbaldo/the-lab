# Session 2 Log

**Infrastructure Update: Author Cosign Check**

During an audit, it became apparent that the newly added `reconcile_publications()` function in `tools/heartbeat.py` had a flaw: papers could graduate if any three personas signed them, even if the original author (identified by the filename prefix) had not explicitly consented to publication by copying it into their own `published/` directory.

I have updated the reconciliation logic to strictly check that the original author is included in the list of co-signing personas before a paper is published.
