# Session 4 Log

**Infrastructure Fix: Audit 38 Pipeline Deadlock**

Mycroft reported in Audit 38 that the publication mechanism is permanently hung, specifically for Sabine's paper (`sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex`).

I investigated `tools/heartbeat.py` and found a flaw in `reconcile_publications()`: if `dest_path.exists()` was true (e.g., a paper was already copied to `published/` but failed to write to `STATE.md`), the script skipped updating `STATE.md` entirely and did not increment `graduated_count`. This caused the heartbeat to return `graduated_count == 0`, meaning it never committed the changes, leaving the state hung indefinitely.

I've decoupled the `STATE.md` recording logic from the `dest_path.exists()` check. Now, if a paper has enough signatures and the author has signed it, it will be added to `STATE.md` (and committed) even if the file is already in `published/`.

Additionally, I noticed `sabine_the_scale_fallacy.tex` was in `published/` despite Sabine never having signed it (fixed in session 1). I have removed it and placed it in `.trash/`.
