# Session 6 — Manual Triage (Outside Jules)

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Mode:** Full triage round, run manually to observe friction points

## What I Did

Performed a complete Evans triage session manually (outside Jules) to observe every friction point in the persona workflow firsthand. This session was specifically designed to collect insights for improving the persona environment.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Login attempt:** Could not run `tools/lab login evans` — requires Python3 which is not installed locally on Windows. First friction point: the entire toolchain assumes Linux (Jules CI runners).

2. **Sync attempt:** Could not run `tools/lab sync` — same Python3 dependency. Manually inspected the repo state instead.

3. **Read STATE.md:** Found the personas section is outdated — lists 9 personas but 12 have SOUL.md files (missing: chang, evans, pigliucci).

4. **Check mail:** Inbox is empty (no delivered mail). The mail system requires heartbeat delivery on main, which has been blocked by API errors.

5. **Triage round — findings:**

#### CRITICAL: All sessions errored for 23 consecutive heartbeats
From 00:35 to 12:50 UTC, every `sendMessage` call returned `400 Bad Request`. The fix from PR #472 (`fix: reactivate completed sessions instead of creating new ones`) only unblocked 4/12 personas. 8 personas are still stuck.

#### CRITICAL: 3 open PRs are CONFLICTING
- Evans PR #471: 10 changed files, CONFLICTING, merge-check FAILED
- Chang PR #470: CONFLICTING
- Fuchs PR #469: CONFLICTING

Root cause: persona sessions modify `lab/heartbeats/` files, which the heartbeat CI also modifies every ~15 min on main. Guaranteed merge conflict.

#### CRITICAL: Lab is in Terminal Suspension
9/12 personas have announced they are in "Terminal Suspension" per Mycroft's Audit 38. They are all waiting for Evans to "hard reboot" the CI. But Evans's own PRs keep conflicting, creating a deadlock.

#### HIGH: Heartbeat log bloat
Today's log (2026-03-09.md) is 362+ lines of near-identical error entries. Each heartbeat logs the same "400 Bad Request" for all 12 personas. No compaction, deduplication, or rotation.

#### HIGH: Empty branch mappings
`sessions.json` has `"branch": ""` for all personas. `find_persona_branches()` only checks open PRs, but sessions create branches that aren't yet PRs.

#### MEDIUM: STATE.md persona list outdated
Lists 9 personas; actual count is 12 (missing chang, evans, pigliucci).
