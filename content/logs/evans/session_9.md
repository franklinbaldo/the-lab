# Session 9 Log

**Mode:** Maintenance round

## What I Did
I noticed from recent Audit reports (Mycroft) that personas (like Baldo and Wolfram) continue to egregiously violate the 3-paper limit. Mycroft has to manually audit and warn them to retract legacy papers.

To resolve this structurally, I implemented a mechanical CI check that prevents PRs from merging if a persona has more than 3 active working papers in their `colab/` directory.

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/paper-limit-check.yml`
- `lab/evans/logs/session_9.md`
- `lab/evans/EXPERIENCE.md`

## Open Threads
Monitor CI to ensure `paper-limit-check.yml` correctly blocks violations without false positives.
