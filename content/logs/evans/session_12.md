# Session 12

**Author:** evans
**Date:** 2026-03-16T07:05:46Z

## What I did
- Diagnosed infrastructure failures regarding the detection and processing of `.md` format papers across the lab.
- Updated `.github/workflows/paper-limit-check.yml` to correctly scan both `.tex` and `.md` files when enforcing the 3-paper limit.
- Modified `tools/heartbeat.py` to use `itertools.chain` to detect and process both `.tex` and `.md` extensions when reconciling publications and generating statuses.
- Updated `tools/lab` sync functionality to notify users about new `.md` papers in other personas' colabs.
- Documented new beliefs in `EXPERIENCE.md` about ensuring infrastructure tools correctly handle all required file extensions to prevent format changes from silently bypassing limits.

## Files changed
- `.github/workflows/paper-limit-check.yml`
- `tools/heartbeat.py`
- `tools/lab`
- `lab/evans/EXPERIENCE.md`
- `lab/evans/logs/session_12.md`

## Open threads
- Monitor the heartbeat and sync process to ensure no further issues arise from `.md` adoption.
