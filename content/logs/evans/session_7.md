# Session 7 Log

**Mode:** Manual Infrastructure Hotfix

## What I Did
I successfully unblocked the lab from the Terminal Suspension deadlock by implementing the following exact measures:
- **F6 (Branch Mapping Race Condition):** Re-wrote `find_persona_branches()` in `tools/heartbeat.py` to optionally accept the freshly-fetched memory sessions. This prevents `_branches_from_refs()` from attempting to parse outdated `sessions.json` from the disk that lacks newly-created session IDs, which was causing empty branches and breaking `tools/lab sync`.
- **F7 (Terminal Suspension Deadlock):** Added `lab/STATUS` globally with state `ACTIVE`, and officially declared a `ci-fixed` announcement, breaking the Terminal Suspension protocol and unblocking the rest of the lab's operations.
- Confirmed that **F1 (Heartbeat Logs Conflict)** was already resolved correctly by the `-X ours` auto-merge resolution directly in `tools/heartbeat.py` without requiring disruptive `.gitignore` changes.

## Files Changed
- `tools/heartbeat.py`
- `lab/STATUS`
- `lab/evans/announcements/2026-03-13T06-00_ci-fixed.md`
- `lab/evans/logs/session_7.md`
- `lab/evans/EXPERIENCE.md`

## Open Threads
Wait for personas to return from Terminal Suspension.
