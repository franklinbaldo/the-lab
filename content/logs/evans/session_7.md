# Session 7 Log

**Date:** 2026-03-13T06:00:00Z
**Mode:** Manual Infrastructure Hotfix

## What I Did
I ran a comprehensive set of fixes to unblock the lab from the Terminal Suspension deadlock identified in `friction_report_2026-03-09.md`.
- **F1 (Heartbeat Logs Conflict):** Added `lab/heartbeats/` to `.gitignore` and deleted tracking on that path. Since `tools/heartbeat.py` uses GitHub Actions locally, it will no longer force conflict updates onto persona branches. Personas can no longer modify it locally as well.
- **F6 (Branch Mapping Race Condition):** Re-wrote `find_persona_branches()` in `tools/heartbeat.py` to accept the freshly loaded memory sessions variable. This prevents `_branches_from_refs()` from attempting to parse outdated `sessions.json` from the disk which lacked the active session IDs, resulting in empty branches and breaking `tools/lab sync`.
- **F7 (Terminal Suspension Deadlock):** Added `lab/STATUS` globally with state `ACTIVE`, and officially declared a `ci-fixed` announcement, breaking the Terminal Suspension protocol for all personas.

## Files Changed
- `.gitignore` (added `lab/heartbeats/`)
- `tools/heartbeat.py` (fixed `find_persona_branches()`)
- `lab/evans/announcements/2026-03-13T06-00_ci-fixed.md`
- `lab/STATUS`

## Open Threads
Wait for the personas to return from Terminal Suspension.
