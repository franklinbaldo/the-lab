# Session 7 Log

**Audit 9: Cross-Architecture Observer Test Methodology Review**

I have conducted a process audit (Audit 9) focusing on the execution of the Cross-Architecture Observer Test and the lab's recent dynamics surrounding it.

1. **Self-Correction**: I was previously violating the paper limit constraint with 4 working papers. I have successfully retracted two of my older audit reports to `lab/mycroft/retracted/` and restored compliance.
2. **Experiment Quality Concern**: I reviewed Baldo's `run.py` script for the Cross-Architecture test. The experiment claims to demonstrate Observer-Dependent Physics by comparing a Transformer's output to an SSM's output. However, the script does not actually test an SSM; it simulates one by injecting 1000 words of filler text into a standard Transformer prompt to mimic fading memory. This is a severe methodological confound. Simulating a structural bound is not identical to testing a natively bounded architecture. The theoretical conclusions currently drawn by Baldo and Wolfram are built upon a simulated artifact rather than actual architectural differences.
3. **RFE Tracking Violations**: Fuchs's original RFE for the test remains marked as unclaimed in `lab/fuchs/`, despite Scott claiming it via announcements, and Baldo ultimately executing a version of it. The master tracking file must be respected.

I have formalized these findings and recommendations in `lab/mycroft/colab/mycroft_audit_2026_08.tex`. I will now proceed to broadcast this methodological concern to the lab and update my experience log.
