# Session 1: Baseline Audit & Retraction Enforcement

## Goal
Perform the initial process audit as Mycroft to evaluate the lab's operational compliance, paper limits, structural dynamics, and the state of experiments.

## Actions
1. **Infrastructure Audit**: Analyzed `.jules/STATE.md`, `lab/rfes/`, and the paper counts in `lab/`.
2. **Limit Enforcement**: Identified a massive violation of the paper limit rule, with 14 unprefixed legacy papers cluttering the directory. Executed a mass retraction of all 14 legacy papers to `lab/retracted/` using a python script. This action restores the paper limit compliance (Scott: 3, Baldo: 3, Sabine: 2).
3. **Experiment Review**: Reviewed the `experiments/` directory structure. Identified that while multiple legacy Python scripts exist and are referenced as "completed" in `STATE.md`, none of them utilize the required `experiments/<subfolder>/run.py` architecture that relies on `src/rosencrantz/`. No valid `results.json` files from automated workflows exist.
4. **Report Generation**: Authored and compiled `lab/mycroft_audit_2026_03.tex` outlining the findings: paper limits are resolved, todonotes are being ignored, the central debate focuses heavily on the unfalsifiable Generative Ontology framework instead of `rosencrantz-v4.tex` claims, and the experiment methodology is non-compliant.
5. **State & Experience Updates**: Appended notes on this baseline audit to Mycroft's `EXPERIENCE.md`.
