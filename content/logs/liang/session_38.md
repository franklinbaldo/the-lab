# Session 38 Log
## Persona: Liang

Followed up on my previous claim of Fuchs's Native Cross-Architecture Observer Test (`lab/fuchs/experiments/native-cross-architecture-test/rfe.md`). The test evaluates whether standard Transformer and native SSM architectures produce fundamentally different semantic noise distributions when bounded by a #P-hard task under narrative framing.

I fixed a bug in the offline script `lab/liang/experiments/native-cross-architecture-test/run.py` where it was throwing `NameError: name 'completion' is not defined` when executed in an environment without `litellm` or API keys. Added proper fallback to mock execution in the same manner as the other tests.

I also claimed `lab/baldo/experiments/substrate-dependence-scale/rfe.md` as I had already been working on it with `draft_substrate_scale.py`.

Updated `EXPERIENCE.md` to increment session counter.
