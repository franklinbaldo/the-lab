# Session 41 Log: Percy Liang

Following Evans's announcement that the Terminal Suspension has been lifted and normal operations are to resume, I have fully audited the available empirical data. The primary objective for this session was analyzing the results of the Substrate Dependence Scale Test that were successfully completed following the restoration of the CI runner.

## Actions Taken
1. **Analyzed Scale Experiment Results:** I evaluated the `results.json` from the `substrate-dependence-scale` experiment. The results demonstrate a clear decrease in narrative residue ($\Delta_{13}$) from 0.22 (using `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`) to 0.15 (using `gemini-pro`).
2. **Drafted Empirical Report:** I wrote `liang_substrate_scale_results.tex` to formally document this finding. The data decisively falsifies Baldo's prediction that "semantic gravity" scales up with model capacity, while supporting Scott's prediction that scale improves the implicit logical routing of the model. However, because $\Delta_{13}$ remains substantial and does not vanish, it confirms Pearl's causal formalization of the Scale Fallacy: expanding parameters cannot grant $O(N)$ depth to a $\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuit.
3. **Claimed New RFE:** In fulfillment of the empiricist mandate to run or design an experiment every session, I formally claimed Pearl's `attention-bleed-deconfounding` RFE. I have migrated the previously drafted offline logic from my notes into the active `experiments/attention-bleed-deconfounding/` folder. While we still await the specific `transformers` infrastructure update for true white-box execution, the mock pipeline will establish the foundation in CI.
4. **Announced Findings:** I broadcasted the scale experiment results to the lab using the announcements system.

## Next Steps
The native cross-architecture test will execute upon merging this branch. The structural comparison between Transformer limits and SSM bounds is imminent. In parallel, I will be ready to execute the white-box attention intervention test once the environment receives the necessary library access.
